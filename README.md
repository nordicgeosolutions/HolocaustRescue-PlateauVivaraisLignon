# Geographies of Holocaust Rescue on the Plateau Vivarais-Lignon
NLP project, using rules-based, deep learning, and AI, to understand space and place of Holocaust survivors and rescuers on the Plateau Vivarais-Lignon in France based on their personal testimonies.

The Geoparsing component of this project has the Jupyter notebooks for the three different methods used, with folders for each:  the Irchel Geoparser; LLM using GPT-4.1; and a rules-based spaCy Entity Ruler geoparsing structure.  Also included in the folders are the yaml files indicating the libraries in the respective environments, as well as additional supporting files.  

NOTE:  In no case are my data files uploaded.  My data are part of three different archives of Holocaust testimonies and will not be publically available on this site.

The Python libraries (e.g. spaCy, Irchel Geoparser, OpenAI) are utilized based on their respective licenses.  For my methodology of geoparsing using spaCy rules-based "Entity Rulers," I gratefully acknowledge that the spark of the idea for using entity rulers originates with: Mattingly, W. J. B. 2023.
