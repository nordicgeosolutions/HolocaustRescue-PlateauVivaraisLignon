# HolocaustRescue-PlateauVivaraisLignon
NLP project, using rules-based, deep learning, and AI, to understand space and place of Holocaust survivors and rescuers on the Plateau Vivarais-Lignon in France based on their personal testimonies.

The Geoparsing component of this project has the Jupyter notebooks for the three different methods used, with folders for each:  the Irchel Geoparser; LLM using GPT-4.1; and a rules-based spaCy Entity Ruler geoparsing structure.  Also included in the folders are the yaml files indicating the libraries in the respective environments, as well as additional supporting files.  

NOTE:  In no case are my data files uploaded.  My data are part of three different archives of Holocaust testimonies and will not be publically available on this site.
