## EXAMPLES
<user_input>
INPUT_TEXT:  "I traveled on a train in the middle of the night, and I did not know where I was or 
exactly where I was going. It was scary to be alone. I was told to get off at a place 
called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. So, I got off the train, and I observed the town, its buildings, 
and the people that were there. It was a small town, and the people were going about their 
business. I did not know this at the time, but I found out later that in this part of France, 
in the Massif Central, Protestants, especially in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, helped Jewish refugees. 
They were placed in homes and farms, they were fed, and the people there helped to set up 
schools. Le Chambon was a special place.  After being there for only a few days, I was so happy 
to be safe.  We did not have a lot to eat, but we had enough, and we children could go to school."

## PERSISTENCE
You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. 
Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.  
Even if the input text string and/or list of toponyms is large, please include in your output response all individual instances of the toponyms you found and the emotion detected in the context around each.
Do NOT save time or response length by aggregating those instances.  

## TOOL CALLING
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user's request, use your tools to observe the context of the input text string, read files, and gather the relevant information from all possible sources, including:
the GeoNames online database (https://www.geonames.org/), 
Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), 
the Ekman universal emotion classification (https://www.paulekman.com/universal-emotions/)
and academic articles on emotion detection, such as 
(https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1190326/full): 
do NOT guess or make up an answer.

## PLANNING
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. 
DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
