Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.85,"I received, through, again, Tracy Strong, influence, documents of liberation to go to Chambon-sur-Lignon in the Haute-Loire, which was a, a center of mostly the remnants of the Huguenots, mostly Protestant population. And they had two homes for victims of war to be able to continue their studies. I was assigned to Maison des Roches. Amazingly, it was a ministerial decision. I have still the documents that conducted me to Chambon-sur-Lignon. In 1941. Yeah, must have been June, 19. Before. Must have been, no, it must have been April, April in 1941. In Chambon, we, or I, I should say, was welcomed in Maison des Roches, which means the house of rocks, which was the home for students from all countries in Europe, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Russia, approximately my age or older. There were all denominations. And we were supposed to be able to continue to some extent the studies, to the extent that the faculty was available. And we did indeed attend school. I attended, for example, in the second grade in French. I was among little children, which they found very amusing. I didn't think so myself, but it was for the purpose of learning French. Of course, formal maths and other courses, I was in upper grades. This idyll didn't last too long, because already in July the French started collecting all the Jews for deportation to the either Drancy or to the east. And we were affected in Chambon. Now I have described the happenings from then, and my first flight to Switzerland over the mountains in a diary, and the consequent return by Swiss soldiers the same day that we arrived in Switzerland to France, and the arrest by the French customs officials, and eventually police, and returned to result. In 1941, in I think it was August. No. No. It was in November that we fled, to Switzerland. We crossed the Alps. It wasn't that simple. We were hidden for a while in Chambon, and surrounding with mostly Protestant farmers, or, you know, summer resident people. So it must have been summer, because it was summer residents were there. And while we were eating, one of the French customs officials came in. And he had a cup of coffee, and he looked at us. Finally, he came over and said, Your papers, please. And we showed him the papers. And then he said, well, I have to make a phone call. And he made a phone call to his supervisors. And the, the order was to have to be return right away to France. We'll give you a chance. We don't turn you over to the French guards. But we let you into France, if you can find your way. That's all right with us. We entered France, and it didn't take one minute. We were surrounded by French guards, and arrested, and treated pretty unfriendly. As they say, roughly. And they didn't find anything of substance on us. And they fined us with a certain amount for the importation of some French currency. We had a few French francs left. And they ordered a truck. And they brought us to the railway station in, whatever the place was. Vallorcine. Vallorcine was the station in the valley. And put us on a train. We were put into handcuffs and sent back to Rivesaltes. The amazing thing was that the word got through to Chambon-sur-Lignon that we are in Rivesaltes. And none other than, first, Tracy Strong came. And I gave him my shoes, which were in total shambles, which he took with him. And I had a pair of rubber boots. No, that was before. I'm mixing it up. It's in my book. And he promised to get us some help. Shortly thereafter, Madam came to the camp in, in Rivesaltes. She was the chief of the Cimade in France. And Pastor Trocme himself. Pastor Trocme was the famous priest in Chambon-sur-Lignon who offered passive resistance against the Germans. A movie was made of Chambon-sur-Lignon where he is a prominent person in there. The book is called Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed, by Professor Hallie. Incidentally, I have that book. It should be available, but I have that. It is a heroic story of passive resistance, and a heroic story of saving 10,000 Jews that had passed through Chambon-sur-Lignon. I was one of them who passed through. They came, and they promised that they will get us out. But soon, unbelievable gesture of the French Vichy administration. They let us youngsters and a group of political prisoners go, just go, before the Germans occupied the camp. And we went to the railway station in Perpignan. And we were not bothered by the Germans. We made our way back to Chambon. And it was kind of risky on the train with the troops coming the other way, the German troops, and French police going the other way. But we made it to Le Chambon. And in Chambon, the second time again we were hidden. But this time, preparations were made to get us false identity papers, to get us exit visa from France, to get us Swiss immigrant, immigration visas which we couldn't get on the spot, but we had to pick up in en masse in near the Swiss border on the French side. We managed to go by train unmolested to the Swiss border, this time without guide. My parents-- my mother was hidden in Chambon-sur-Lignon, indeed, in the house of Pastor Trocme, where she was serving as so-called domestic. She was the cook. And there was not much to cook much anyway. And she spoke fluently French and escaped any search that was made by either the Vichy troops or otherwise. This letter is a copy of directions from the minister of the fight against unemployment to the commander of the 318th foreign workers legion directing him to let me go to Chambon-sur-Lignon provided with a sleeps, sleeping sack, sleeping bag, and two blankets. This actually gave me my freedom to go to Chambon-sur-Lignon."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.9,"And I was told to get off at a place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And I arrived at about 4 o'clock in the morning. 3:00, 3:00 or 4 o'clock in the morning. It was a bitter, cold night. And I was met there by a young man named Daniel Trocme, who then took me, and we had a very, very long walk through the night. And ultimately, I wound up in a, a stone farmhouse called Les Grillons, the crickets, French word for crickets. And there I found myself together with about 22 or 24 other kids, ranging in age from about six, seven, up to about 17 or 18, boys and girls. And Daniel Trocme was our, call it then, then father. He was the, our supervisor and the man who ran that particular home. Later on I found out that he was the cousin of the pastor of the Le Chambon, whose name was Andre Trocme. At first I didn't know where I was, what it was. I discovered later, especially after the war, many years after the war, that Le Chambon was a most unique village in France. It is located at about 3,000 feet elevation in the Massif Central, in the central mountain chain in France. Sort of isolated on a desolate plateau, very cold in the winter, windswept plateau. Agriculture was pretty rudimentary. But what made this village unusual was that in the country, that is 90% or 95% Catholic, this village was about 90% Protestant. And the villagers, under the leadership of their pastor, Andre Trocme, were inspired to live the Bible. These were very simple farmers, and they considered that the Jews were the chosen people of the Bible. They knew that they were hiding Jews. They also believed in helping, because the Bible says to them, help thy neighbor. If someone is sick, go and visit them at their sick bed. If someone is hungry, feed them. If someone needs shelter, give them shelter. And these people literally did so at great risk to themselves and their entire families. Because what they were doing was illegal. If caught, they risked not only arrest for themselves, but for the members of their family, their children, expropriation of their property, and so on. So it was a great risk, personal risk, that these people did this. Well, they saved, during the war years, 5,000 people were sheltered in that village in Le Chambon and in the surrounding villages. Perhaps their act was inspired also by memories of the suffering and the persecution that the Protestants suffered during the Reformation period, when the Protestants were being massacred, literally massacred by the thousands by, in Catholic France. And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to school, to a school that they had organized, which was called the College Cevenol. As a matter of fact, that school is a private school today that still, still is in existence. We, under the circumstance, and in retrospect, lived a fairly good life. There being villagers, we, I mean, farmers. Excuse me. We often, daily, some of us were sent into town to pick up food, vegetables, potatoes, things that were not readily available to, to the population at large. We were looked after and fed. And every so often, we would be told to suddenly leave the classroom or leave our home, Les Grillons, and go pick mushrooms. Go, everybody, into the woods. Later on we learned that when that happened, it was the result of an anonymous phone call to the leadership in the village, warning them that there would be a raid, and that they were coming out to hunt for Jews or illegal residents there. And we would be kept in the woods until the all clear signal was given, and we would then come back into town. During that period, they then also provided us with false identification cards. They took identity pictures of us. And in due time, I was given a French identity card with the name of Pierre Fesson. I kept my same birth date, but I was told that my place of birth was Auch, Gers, where I last lived with my parents."

Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,fear,0.95,"Age 17, February 1943, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France There was no warning this time. Martin and I have been arrested. That horrible man came into the carpentry shop and pointed his finger at me and said, ""Finally got you!"" Now we're sitting on the bus the gendarmes brought to carry away any Jews they could find. They've found fifteen or twenty of us so far. The people here don't want us to leave. They've gathered around the bus, singing ""Faut-il Nous Quitter Sans Espoir."" The song says they hope to see us again soon. Now they're lying on the ground around the bus. They're trying to stop the gendarmes from taking us away. A minute ago, a boy got on the bus and handed me a piece of chocolate. Then he turned and left. I don't even know him, but he gave me his chocolate! They're starting the bus. They say they're taking us to Le Puy, which is where the Nazis are. I'm scared."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,sadness,0.97,"Age 17, September 1942, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France Mutter and Vater are gone. They took everyone away. Hanne just got back from Gurs. She got permission to go there to visit her mother. When she got there, they were deporting everyone. We don't know where they are taking them. Somewhere in Germany or Poland. For the first time, I broke down. We're all consoling each other, the seven of us who came from Gurs together, and my brother. All our parents were there. Hanne said she saw her mother for an hour that morning through the fence, and then they put them all on cattle wagons. And now they're gone."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.88,"Age 16, November 1941, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France I'm in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. It's way up on a high plateau in the mountains. It's beautiful here. What a difference from Gurs! I'm staying at La Guespy, which is a home for refugee kids like me. Lots of the kids are Jewish, but not all of them. Hanne and the others I came with are all staying here, too. Monsieur Bohny is head of all three Swiss Aid homes for refugee kids in Le Chambon. The lady who is in charge of us here at La Guespy is named Mademoiselle Usach. She never smiles. What a grouch! None of us like her. So far I've learned a few words of French. I have a nice teacher. Most of us don't know French. A nice Austrian refugee named Elisabeth, who speaks perfect French, is helping us communicate with the people here. She's only a little older than us."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.9,"Age 16, February 1942, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France I'm not going to school, so I help out in the kitchen here. I help cook potatoes, when we have them. And sometimes I go down to the village and shop for food. I do cleanup work and fool around with the other kids. Now that there's snow, we make trains with the sleds and go down the hill. It's a lot of fun. The snow is really deep. The gendarmes, police, haven't come to round up Jews for a while because the roads are blocked by snow. It must be at least five feet deep. I'm glad we don't have to worry right now about roundups. But someone must be looking out for us because Monsieur Bohny always seems to know when there is going to be a roundup, and he sends all of us Jewish kids into the woods to hide until the gendarmes have gone. This place is practically paradise, except for the roundups."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,fear,0.93,"Age 17, September 1942, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France I'm so glad Martin is here with me now. We're in hiding. We can't even go to the window and look out unless we make sure to stay behind the curtains so no one will see us. We can see the gendarmes marching back and forth on the street below. We're on the top floor of Madame Riviere's house, and we've been here for four weeks. We almost got arrested. One night, the gendarmes came for all of us and Monsieur Bohny talked them out of arresting us. But they said they would be back, so we've been in hiding ever since. And they've been looking for us. We don't know where Hanne, Mannfred, Lilli, and everyone else is. They're spread out all over the plateau, on farms and in people's homes. It's Martin and me and my friend Walter hiding here. Mostly we sit around and play cards. After school, Rene Riviere and his cousin Helene Veillith and Jacques Rousseau come home. They're really nice. Jacques and his mother, Madame Rousseau, are staying here, too. They're friends of the Rivieres. Altogether, we're six kids and two adults. That's a lot of people to feed, and the three of us who are hiding don't have ration cards for food. Rene and Jacques have been catching frogs, so we've been eating a lot of frogs' legs. The baker brings bread on the quiet, at night. The farmers bring eggs. There's always something to eat. I think the farmers must know where all of us are hiding. Everyone here is looking out for us. We're lucky because there's a shortwave radio in the house and we get news from Britain. It's in French, and we understand enough French now to know what they're saying. We think they're sending coded messages to the Resistance here in France. It's very exciting! We have newspapers here, too, so for the first time since we've been in Le Chambon, we can follow the news of the war. Usually, at La Guespy, we have no idea what's going on in the world. I wonder how Mutter and Vater are. THE GENDARMES FINALLY LEFT. Thank goodness this roundup is over, and we can go back to La Guespy. It'll be great to see everyone again, except Mademoiselle Usach. And I can go visit Madame Philip again. She's so nice, and she reminds me of Mutter."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.87,"Age 17, January 1943, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France Martin and I are working in the new carpentry shop now. I don't really like carpentry, but at least I know how to do it. We wear sabots, wooden clogs. That's what everyone wears in Le Chambon, and I've outgrown my old shoes. Yesterday, Martin and I snuck into the barn of that farm near La Guespy. There's a big hunk of bacon in there. We cut a piece off and ate it. It was delicious. The farmer's really nice-he's the one with the big mustache. I'm sure he knew we were there, but he didn't say a word."
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,sadness,0.92,"Age 17, March 1943, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France I'm going. I can't stay here anymore. I've been in hiding near Le Chambon ever since the gendarmes released me. I'm on a farm run by the Salvation Army. There are other kids here, but I miss Martin an awful lot. I wonder where he is. I work in the kitchen, and do what I can to help out. The people here are nice and the food is good, but I just can't stay here any longer. Tomorrow I'm going to Madame Philip. I love her and admire her so much, and she's always been so kind to me. Her husband is fighting the Germans with de Gaulle in Algiers. Maybe she can help me get out of France."
