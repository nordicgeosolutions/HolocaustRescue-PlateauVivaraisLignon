Haute-Loire,45.1333,3.9167,sadness,0.85,I am sad and weary. During rest hour Mrs. Cavailhon called me. She received a letter asking whether she wanted to send some children to a very nice school in Haute-Loire at an elevation of one thousand meters.  She selected me and another boy. I'll be able to go there but she is afraid that perhaps I won't be safe there.,312,5

France,46.603354,1.888334,neutral,0.72,"And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to school, to a school that they had organized, which was called the College Cevenol. As a matter of fact, that school is a private school today that still, still is in existence. We, under the circumstance, and in retrospect, lived a fairly good life. There being villagers, we, I mean, farmers. Excuse me. We often, daily, some of us were sent into town to pick up food, vegetables, potatoes, things that were not readily available to, to the population at large. We were looked after and fed. And every so often, we would be told to suddenly leave the classroom or leave our home, Les Grillons, and go pick mushrooms. Go, everybody, into the woods. Later on we learned that when that happened, it was the result of an anonymous phone call to the leadership in the village, warning them that there would be a raid, and that they were coming out to hunt for Jews or illegal residents there. And we would be kept in the woods until the all clear signal was given, and we would then come back into town. During that period, they then also provided us with false identification cards. They took identity pictures of us. And in due time, I was given a French identity card with the name of Pierre Fesson. I kept my same birth date, but I was told that my place of birth was Auch, Gers, where I last lived with my parents. What kinds of contact, if any, did you ever have with either the resistance or with any of the, the groups that were attempting to fight the Germans from within France? The only contact, or the first contact, if you will, were in Le Chambon. There was, in the area, not in Le Chambon itself, but in the area, apparently there was a Jewish underground organization. I think at one point I may have been taken together with several other kids to this group. I remember they were dancing the Hora, which was the first time I ever saw that. And we sang some songs, resistance songs. The, the people in Le Chambon did the right thing. And if they worried about whether or not it could affect them personally or their family, they put justice right before any other consideration. So I say to, to the young people today in the schools, if you see an injustice being committed, don't turn your back on it. Get involved. Speak up.",600,4

Saint-Etienne,45.4397,4.3872,neutral,0.71,"It was a little village up above Saint-Etienne, about 15 miles away. The head of that village was a famous pastor, a Protestant pastor by the name of Trocme. He and his wife and the children lived, of course, in the, in the, what do you call the house that belongs to the church, where they live? And there were 5,000 villager there. And somebody had heard that someone in that village would hide them. So all of a sudden, one Jewish family came there and went to the pastor. And he gave them to a family. And that family came to him after and said, what are we going to do with these people? We don't want, we don't want to be responsible for them. They can arrest us because we're hiding them. We can't do that. So the pastor took a whole bunch of people, there were 5,000 in that village, and put them in a big place in the church and talked to them and said to them, now, look. Our duty is to save these people. If they came to us, it's because there is no other place to go to be saved, and you're not going to denounce them. And I'm telling you something. We have no weapon. We have nothing to defend them. We can't defend ourselves. All we have are the weapons of our spirit. And it's going to have to act so that each and every one of you feel that it's his duty to do something. And 5,000 villagers hid 5,000 Jews. So Le Chambon was a fantastic place. And there was a little, tiny children boarding school there. And my children were there many times. Every time, something was wrong, every time I wasn't sure what was going to happen, I would bring them up there.",600,4

I attended, for example, in the second grade in French. I was among little children, which they found very amusing. I didn't think so myself, but it was for the purpose of learning French. Of course, formal maths and other courses, I was in upper grades. This idyll didn't last too long, because already in July the French started collecting all the Jews for deportation to the either Drancy or to the east. And we were affected in Chambon. Now I have described the happenings from then, and my first flight to Switzerland over the mountains in a diary, and the consequent return by Swiss soldiers the same day that we arrived in Switzerland to France, and the arrest by the French customs officials, and eventually police, and returned to result. In 1941, in I think it was August. No. No. It was in November that we fled, to Switzerland. We crossed the Alps. It wasn't that simple. We were hidden for a while in Chambon, and surrounding with mostly Protestant farmers, or, you know, summer resident people. So it must have been summer, because it was summer residents were there. And while we were eating, one of the French customs officials came in. And he had a cup of coffee, and he looked at us. Finally, he came over and said, Your papers, please. And we showed him the papers. And then he said, well, I have to make a phone call. And he made a phone call to his supervisors. And the, the order was to have to be return right away to France. We'll give you a chance. We don't turn you over to the French guards. But we let you into France, if you can find your way. That's all right with us. We entered France, and it didn't take one minute. We were surrounded by French guards, and arrested, and treated pretty unfriendly. As they say, roughly. And they didn't find anything of substance on us. And they fined us with a certain amount for the importation of some French currency. We had a few French francs left. And they ordered a truck. And they brought us to the railway station in, whatever the place was. Vallorcine. Vallorcine was the station in the valley. And put us on a train. We were put into handcuffs and sent back to Rivesaltes. The amazing thing was that the word got through to Chambon-sur-Lignon that we are in Rivesaltes. And none other than, first, Tracy Strong came. And I gave him my shoes, which were in total shambles, which he took with him. And I had a pair of rubber boots. No, that was before. I'm mixing it up. It's in my book.

They let us youngsters and a group of political prisoners go, just go, before the Germans occupied the camp. And we went to the railway station in Perpignan. And we were not bothered by the Germans. We made our way back to Chambon. And it was kind of risky on the train with the troops coming the other way, the German troops, and French police going the other way. But we made it to Le Chambon. And in Chambon, the second time again we were hidden. But this time, preparations were made to get us false identity papers, to get us exit visa from France, to get us Swiss immigrant, immigration visas which we couldn't get on the spot, but we had to pick up in en masse in near the Swiss border on the French side. We managed to go by train unmolested to the Swiss border, this time without guide. My parents-- my mother was hidden in Chambon-sur-Lignon, indeed, in the house of Pastor Trocme, where she was serving as so-called domestic. She was the cook. And there was not much to cook much anyway. And she spoke fluently French and escaped  any search that was made by either the Vichy troops or otherwise. This letter is a copy of directions from the minister of the fight against unemployment to the commander of the 318th foreign workers legion directing him to let me go to Chambon-sur-Lignon provided with a sleeps, sleeping sack, sleeping bag, and two blankets.
