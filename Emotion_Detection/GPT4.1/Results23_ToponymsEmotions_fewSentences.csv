Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,joy,0.95,"Age 16, November 1941, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France. I'm in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. It's way up on a high plateau in the mountains. It's beautiful here. What an amazing difference from Gurs! I'm staying at La Guespy, which is a home for refugees.  My friend just arrived, and before she came she saw her mother for an hour that morning through the fence, and then they put them all on cattle wagons and they were deported. And now they're gone.  We are not sure, but we think they took them to Drancy.  Martin and I are working in the new carpentry shop now. I don't really like carpentry, but at least I know how to do it, and at least I am safe."
