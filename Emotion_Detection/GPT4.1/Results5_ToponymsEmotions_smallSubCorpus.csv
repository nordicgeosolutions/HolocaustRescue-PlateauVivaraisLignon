Your son is thinking of you. Friday, January 15, 1943 We were told that we'll have to get out in two or three days.

There being villagers, we, I mean, farmers. Excuse me. We often, daily, some of us were sent into town to pick up food, vegetables, potatoes, things that were not readily available to, to the population at large. We were looked after and fed. And every so often, we would be told to suddenly leave the classroom or leave our home, Les Grillons, and go pick mushrooms. Go, everybody, into the woods. Later on we learned that when that happened, it was the result of an anonymous phone call to the leadership in the village, warning them that there would be a raid, and that they were coming out to hunt for Jews or illegal residents there. And we would be kept in the woods until the all clear signal was given, and we would then come back into town. During that period, they then also provided us with false identification cards. They took identity pictures of us. And in due time, I was given a French identity card with the name of Pierre Fesson. I kept my same birth date, but I was told that my place of birth was Auch, Gers, where I last lived with my parents.",865,6
