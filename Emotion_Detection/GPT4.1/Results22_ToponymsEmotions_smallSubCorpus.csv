It is much colder here than in Marseilles. I attend fifth class but no Latin. I got here one trimester too late. Wednesday, January 20, 1943 I go to school. Often think of you. I found an Austrian with whom I get along well and practice speaking German. His name is Kurt Grossmann. His mother disappeared like you.

Friday, January 22, 1943 The UGIF now sends me three hundred francs every month. Mr. T. however takes them. Sunday, January 31, 1943 Again another month begins and I am still without news from you. Monday, February 1, 1943 ﻿So by late December, December 31, I was notified that I would be shipped off to another location. And I was put on a train. And on New Year's Eve, they explained to me that there would be fewer patrols and police out, checking people's, traveler's papers, identity papers. And I was told to get off at a place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And I arrived at about 4 o'clock in the morning. 3:00, 3:00 or 4 o'clock in the morning. It was a bitter, cold night. And I was met there by a young man named Daniel Trocme, who then took me, and we had a very, very long walk through the night. And ultimately, I wound up in a, a stone farmhouse called Les Grillons, the crickets, French word for crickets. And there I found myself together with about 22 or 24 other kids, ranging in age from about six, seven, up to about 17 or 18, boys and girls. And Daniel Trocme was our, call it then, then father. He was the, our supervisor and the man who ran that particular home. Later on I found out that he was the cousin of the pastor of the Le Chambon, whose name was Andre Trocme. At first I didn't know where I was, what it was. I discovered later, especially after the war, many years after the war, that Le Chambon was a most unique village in France. It is located at about 3,000 feet elevation in the Massif Central, in the central mountain chain in France. Sort of isolated on a desolate plateau, very cold in the winter, windswept plateau. Agriculture was pretty rudimentary. But what made this village unusual was that in the country, that is 90% or 95% Catholic, this village was about 90% Protestant. And the villagers, under the leadership of their pastor, Andre Trocme, were inspired to live the Bible. These were very simple farmers, and they considered that the Jews were the chosen people of the Bible. They knew that they were hiding Jews. They also believed in helping, because the Bible says to them, help thy neighbor. If someone is sick, go and visit them at their sick bed. If someone is hungry, feed them. If someone needs shelter, give them shelter. And these people literally did so at great risk to themselves and their entire families. Because what they were doing was illegal. If caught, they risked not only arrest for themselves, but for the members of their family, their children, expropriation of their property, and so on. So it was a great risk, personal risk, that these people did this. Well, they saved, during the war years, 5,000 people were sheltered in that village in Le Chambon and in the surrounding villages.  Perhaps their act was inspired also by memories of the suffering and the persecution that the Protestants suffered during the Reformation period, when the Protestants were being massacred, literally massacred by the thousands by, in Catholic France. And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to school, to a school that they had organized, which was called the College Cevenol. As a matter of fact, that school is a private school today that still, still is in existence. We, under the circumstance, and in retrospect, lived a fairly good life. There being villagers, we, I mean, farmers. Excuse me. We often, daily, some of us were sent into town to pick up food, vegetables, potatoes, things that were not readily available to, to the population at large. We were looked after and fed. And every so often, we would be told to suddenly leave the classroom or leave our home, Les Grillons, and go pick mushrooms. Go, everybody, into the woods. Later on we learned that when that happened, it was the result of an anonymous phone call to the leadership in the village, warning them that there would be a raid, and that they were coming out to hunt for Jews or illegal residents there. And we would be kept in the woods until the all clear signal was given, and we would then come back into town. During that period, they then also provided us with false identification cards. They took identity pictures of us. And in due time, I was given a French identity card with the name of Pierre Fesson. I kept my same birth date, but I was told that my place of birth was Auch, Gers, where I last lived with my parents. What kinds of contact, if any, did you ever have with either the resistance or with any of the, the groups that were attempting to fight the Germans from within France? The only contact, or the first contact, if you will, were in Le Chambon. There was, in the area, not in Le Chambon itself, but in the area, apparently there was a Jewish underground organization. I think at one point I may have been taken together with several other kids to this group. I remember they were dancing the Hora, which was the first time I ever saw that. And we sang some songs, resistance songs. The, the people in Le Chambon did the right thing. And if they worried about whether or not it could affect them personally or their family, they put justice right before any other consideration. So I say to, to the young people today in the schools, if you see an injustice being committed, don't turn your back on it. Get involved. Speak up. ﻿And I got confronted with people who were doing the sneaking out of children. And so here and there I was find myself having a few children on my hands and tried to find a place to put them. And so we established a kind of a chain, being tremendously helped by the priest and the nuns who were taking them into monasteries or in their own quarters until they could place them in farm. And this was really, the women were mainly involved in that. I mean, it was one of the big, one of the big way you could help. I mean, there were so many children who were abandoned, abandoned by the Germans, when they took their parents and left the children behind. I mean, and those kids could practically speak no French. And it was the biggest tragedy of that time was to have those people who came from Eastern Europe and escaped to France. And France was the haven. I mean, they thought nothing could happen to them when they got to France. They didn't realize that they would be picked up there just as well as they could have been in Germany or in Hungary or in Romania or anywhere else. And they never talked the language. And they were, they were easy prey for the Germans because they themselves didn't have enough, enough knowledge of a language. And if they spoke the language a little, they had a terrible accent. So they were immediately denounced. And the children were usually left? Sometimes. Sometimes not, depending. So part of the resistance was to work together and find farms for these children? Yeah. We find place to, place to put them. And it was good that we knew where they were, and we knew, we knew the kind of name they had. And they were given the farmer's name, of course. In many, many instance, 90% of the time, they didn't think that the father was not their parents. They thought they were their children. They didn't know any better, to a point that when we finally were liberated, and when we got those children back, I mean, they simply spat in our face because they heard they were Jewish. They said, I don't want to die. I want to live. I don't be, I'm not a Jewish person. I am not Jewish. Don't tell me I'm Jewish. And this was one of the greatest problems that we had, because to try to get them by force, get them away, we established those children homes for that reason, to put them together and be able to educate them as Jewish children and try to go beyond what they wanted, I mean, because they were too young, anyway, to know what it was all about. But they had been fed with the terrible propaganda that the Germans did for five years. I mean, every day there was something against the Jews. There was never a day without it. And so they learned that when you're Jewish, you die. And that's all they knew. I mean, there is no way to know why you escape and why you survive. There is no way. All I say is that if the war had last only for another six months, we could no longer go, because we changed our name so many time. We changed our location so many times. We changed everything about ourselves. You could no more hide yourself. It was getting impossible. Yeah. I put my children in, I told you once about Le Chambon. I mean, if you ever go to the museum, the Holocaust museum in Washington, you'll see a very good display of what Chambon was. It was a little village up above Saint-Etienne, about 15 miles away. The head of that village was a famous pastor, a Protestant pastor by the name of Trocme. He and his wife and the children lived, of course, in the, in the, what do you call the house that belongs to the church, where they live? And there were 5,000 villager there. And somebody had heard that someone in that village would hide them. So all of a sudden, one Jewish family came there and went to the pastor. And he gave them to a family. And that family came to him after and said, what are we going to do with these people? We don't want, we don't want to be responsible for them. They can arrest us because we're hiding them. We can't do that. So the pastor took a whole bunch of people, there were 5,000 in that village, and put them in a big place in the church and talked to them and said to them, now, look. Our duty is to save these people. If they came to us, it's because there is no other place to go to be saved, and you're not going to denounce them. And I'm telling you something. We have no weapon. We have nothing to defend them. We can't defend ourselves. All we have are the weapons of our spirit. And it's going to have to act so that each and every one of you feel that it's his duty to do something. And 5,000 villagers hid 5,000 Jews. So Le Chambon was a fantastic place. And there was a little, tiny children boarding school there. And my children were there many times. Every time, something was wrong, every time I wasn't sure what was going to happen, I would bring them up there."
