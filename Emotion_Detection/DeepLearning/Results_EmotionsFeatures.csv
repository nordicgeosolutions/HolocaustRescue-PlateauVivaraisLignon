place. It's called Les Tavas, which is, there were maybe four farms. That 
was the whole village, four or five farms.

It was part of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And Le Chambon-sur-Lignon has 
become famous because a Frenchman named Pierre Sauvage mad",surprise,0.3703346252441406,6

others who worked as student aids, an Austrian who had studied law, and 
other personnel who lived in the village.  The home operated from May to 
October.  Then we were able to open the second home, ""L'Abric.""  We had

At the end we had around 200 children in the village. That was the situation. 

Now in 1942, the persecutions began, and we experienced them as well.  
There was a demonstration by the students from the",disgust,0.6996121406555176,1

these people, and the first action was at our home.  That's where they

We had another way of staying together, my wife told of the children and 
their music.  We sang a lot in our homes. There was another 15 minutes o",fear,0.9043635129928589,2

them happy, just singing together.  We also participated in the Christmas

some extent and also played the organ in the church at one time.  The 
chorus members were, for instance, ",joy,0.9730753302574158,3

There were further distinctions here.  The children who could go home

very special at this time. 

Yes, Dr. Forestier (Roger Le Forestier) was one of the two village 
doctors.  He had earlier worked with Albert Schweitzer in Africa.  He 
lived near us by the L'Abric home and we often had contact with him.  He 
was",neutral,0.32395315170288086,4

the story of Dr. Forestier.  I happened to be there because I spoke 
German. I was also otherwise called upon in the village, later, when the

with a small tank group, and already they had begun shooting at 
houses.  We worried about the children, and we got together in the 
village, what should we do?  I still remember the date, it was July 9, 
1944.  We decided to designate Le Chambon-sur-Lignon as an open city for 
children.  ",fear,0.936111331,2

with a note  s",fear,0.9292292,2

Wesleyan, and who wrote the first book on this little town.

At the time, I imagine my parents didn't know that much about the fact 
that this village was going to be so, quote, heroic. But it was a very 
pretty area, and in fact, it was, it had a Quaker influence because it 
had a college, Collège ",fear,0.38988161087036133,2

took one look at this a",neutral,0.6092582941055298,4

also were there, and kids. And I remember that almost every day, I was

play Monopoly.

So, because we were sort of three kilometers away from the village, we

And it was, for me, a curious life. I was by then, you know, I was 10,

were too happy to have it. 

One time, yes, there were a couple of crises, at some point.  There were 
rarely Germans up there in that village, for some reason, even after all

were more wounded, who were recuperating. So",joy,0.946379542,3
