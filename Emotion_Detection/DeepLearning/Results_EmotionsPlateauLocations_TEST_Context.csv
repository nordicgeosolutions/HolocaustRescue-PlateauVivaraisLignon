Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"t since we had no reserves.  We had no 
heating materials. We frequently had to try to purchase tree stems, saw 
them, and before they were dry, put them in the oven.  As a result, we 
often had sooty rooms because there was no alternative.  Nevertheless, we 
were able to withstand the winter quite well.  There were times when we 
were cut off, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is about 1000 meters high, on a high 
plateau, and it is often very cold in winter and has a lot of snow.  This 
was the place, as my wife had already told you, where the girl came to us 
with typhus, and we had to take care of her for three weeks together with 
other children and without much room.  For that reason, we had written to 
Rivesaltes,",fear,0.40486058592796326,2

other children and without much room.  For that reason, we had written to 
Rivesaltes, and not very pleasantly.    
 
That was the first contact.  Then in April, I had to leave the home for a 
while.  There was also a Swiss nurse who worked there and I left her 
alone at the home. Afterwards, I returned to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I 
continued to resist and the total willingness on the part of the 
population was so great - we always had good relations with Pastor 
Trocmé.  He also continuously sent a representative from the church 
congregation and from the community to our discussions, and he searched 
all over for ways for us to get things that we needed.  That is how w",fear,0.27244389057159424,2

that belonged to the Salvation Army.  They had run it earlier but were no 
longer able to do so and they also took on 40 children.  That is, the 
children's aid society provided the financing, had the responsibility, 
chose the children, and so we had a fairly large center in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  
At the end we had around 200 children in the village. That was the situation. 

Now in 1942, the persecutions began, and we experienced them as well.

more consideration with Protestant Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, no one knows 
for sure. He came and visited our home.  We repeated how concerned we 
were about our children.  He reassured us that it was just about paper 
control, they always said that.  That was on August 23.  Two days later, 
we experienced another situation.  At 4 a.m., our house, L'Abric, was 
surrounded by eight policemen who wanted to co",fear,0.6328797936439514,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"hildren between ages 12 and 18, who might have been 
in danger, to L'Abric House in order to better protect them.  They were 
sleeping in the dining room and were found by the police.  The leader of 
the house search was a French Colonel from Corsica and the Chef de La 
Sûreté des Departements.    
 
So, the two chief officers led the action in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and 
they now ascertained that the children's papers were in order.  We always 
had papers that were accepted by the Mairie, that is, by the mayor's 
office, even if they may have contained occasional inaccuracies and 
corrections, periods around birth dates, etc.  The papers were in order 
and yet they weren't certain.  Although they weren't on t",fear,0.9436904788017273,2

that, all the help, so that some of these children could be hidden in the 
farms and others, in a kind of ladder from one to another, got into 
Switzerland, that was done largely by the citizenry under the guidance of 
the wife of André Philip, the later d'Ecole Minister of Interior.   
 
She was responsible for organizing this in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and that 
was nice. The entire village worked together.  We did a little, but the 
citizenry participated and that pleased us.  It was a real experience. 
The police remained in the village another four weeks.  They brought in 
police dogs to search the forests.  They threatened the two pastors, and 
the three aid organizations received a letter (",fear,0.6776383519172668,2

student who worked with us in the summer.  He was outside with the 
children playing in the forest and was leaning against a tree while the 
children were playing ball.  A gendarme came along, tapped him on the 
shoulder, and told him he had to search the area.  He apparently thought 
the student didn't quite look like a native of Chambon-sur-Lignon and 
that perhaps he was a Jewish refugee and he wanted to give him the chance 
to get away.  This showed that there were individuals here and there, 
even with the police.  It was the difference between the pure Vichy 
police and the gendarmerie from the area, they were not the same!  So, 
even that helped.  The time passed, and they left after f",fear,0.621751606464386,2

even that helped.  The time passed, and they left after four weeks and 
not one of the 72 refugees was taken away.  On the first day, they had us 
under surveillance in La Guespy (one of the homes).  They had taken Mr. 
Steckler to Le Puy, but on the second day, I was able to free him in Le 
Puy and take him back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was a victory for 
us, for all who had stood up for the refugees, for the children, but also 
the adults, and a common victory for the work of those who were there for 
the children such as the citizenry, the church ministers.  So, these were 
some impressions from 1942. 
 
The Huguenots were a minority.  They had to defend themselves, and ",anger,0.279035359621048,0
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," been an objective truth, but 
in a war situation, one must not quarrel over objective truth. The 
Huguenots had to defend themselves.  In that area, even earlier, they had 
taken in workers' children during the summer vacations from St. Etienne.  
Then, during the Spanish Civil War, they took in Spanish refugees.  It 
had become a tradition in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and for that reason we 
were able to carry out this mission together.  The further expansion, 
that the Swiss Red Cross, Children's Aid, as it was called in 1942, came

It's always the case with all organizations; they need personalities that 
form them.  The organization is a crude, bad chess affair, supported by 
certain people, and Pastor Trocmé was a conscientious objector - he

This was not a comfortable life for the people up there.  The need to 
fight has been there for centuries.  Life was not easy; one had to fight 
that and then defend one's convictions and stick with them, and that did 
perhaps shape them to some extent. There were communities there as well, 
in various areas, perhaps not so spectacular as in Chambon-sur-Lignon. 

Something came together there.  At the time there were about 28 
children's homes up there.  There is a special climate there that 
contributed somehow.  But there were other places; they just weren't so 
well known. Yes, this kind of activity could be better accomplished in 
somewhat isolated areas. 

Yes, the Gestapo, they were actually more ",neutral,0.5731602907180786,4

had a room ready for Mrs. Forestier where she could talk with him and 
they brought him in.  I saw him myself with the marks on his face, he 
had been beaten, he had blue marks, and I saw that.  Mrs. Forestier 
spent about ten or 15 minutes with her husband, and then we all returned 
to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was shortly, I know it was a week or ten 
days, before the liberation.    

Le Puy was liberated on August 19, 1944, and just before and shortly 
thereafter, I'm not exactly sure, the prisoners were sent north. We later 
learned that he never made it beyond Lyon, and that there he was in

that, and on another occasion, during a punitive action by German troops.  
They had come from Valence and were about 40 kilometers from Chambon-sur-Lignon 
with a small tank group, and already they had begun shooting at 
houses.  We worried about the children, and we got together in the 
village, what should we do?  I still remember the date, it was July 9,

considered this, and we were generally able to convince them.  Then we 
wanted to arrange this, so Pastor Trocmé together with the mayor and I 
went up against the Germans with the white flag in order to negotiate.  
Fortunately, it was unnecessary since the entire column (of troops) 
turned around and went back some 30 kilometers before Chambon-sur-Lignon.  
These were some of the common experiences, aid actions and people 
involving Pastor Trocmé.

children.  There were about 800 children who were in Chambon-sur-Lignon 
between 1941 and 1944 and who took something with them from their 
experiences in Chambon-sur-Lignon.  So, that was something about this 
period.  Thank you. 

I spoke earlier about the 25th of August in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
""L'Abric.""  That was a spectacular action for us, and we were happy about 
that, but we were still worried.  We were very careful, and organized an 
alarm system.  The distance from one house to another was still about two 
kilometers.  So mornings, we knew that the police began their work 
around 4 a.m.  Someone was always prepared, and we care",joy,0.41944608092308044,3

We also had a cook from the north who had come south with a very tall, 
lean young man.  He was a Canadian, had been in Dunkirk with his company, 
and had missed the ship. She had concealed him, and then taken him 
through the demarcation line as a deaf-mute nephew.  She learned that it 
might be possible to find work and lodging in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and 
they eventually came to us through the pastor.  We needed a cook, and the 
young man worked for us as a handyman.  He did housework, shopped for 
food, repaired vehicles, shoes, furniture, etc.  Naturally, whenever 
German or French police came, we had to hide him.  There were also some 
children who had to be hidden.  We had a boy, Serge, w",fear,0.5560951232910156,2

five Swiss, and all the others were people from many different nations.  
One could talk at least another hour about their various life stories.  
But we were happy that we could set the course in the right direction and 
that we were able to prevent a deportation.  This was true both for my 
wife in Rivesaltes as well as for us later in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  The 
number, how many, is difficult to say, but at the time, there, we could 
realize that they remained here because of our help.  What else? 

There were also many Catholic families who helped.  I had said that at 
the Christmas celebration, it always went further, and the entire action 
was not just a Protestant action.  The OSE (French-Jewis",joy,0.957705020904541,3

it was really a beautiful view, and just marvelous countryside. Somewhat 
mountainous, but the central mountains, not the Alps or anything.

So they rented it, we rented it, and we had a place to go to in the 
summer with my governess, because my parents didn't come the whole time. 
And Le Chambon-sur-Lignon had other families, refugees from Paris, who 
also were there, and kids. And I remember that almost every day, I was 
visited by some of these kids who lived in the village, Jewish girls, to 
play Monopoly.

We played Monopoly almost every day. And I didn't really like that girl 
that she knew, I didn't like her, but she showed up every day.  But ",joy,0.6837300062179565,3

having stuff to sell, I don't know, but we did. So we did, we'd come back 
with a dozen eggs and a pound of butter, you know. I don't know that they 
were identifying me as Jewish. I never thought of it as being anti-
Jewish, as I say. But they must have known that we were because who else 
came begging for food from Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I don't know. I haven't 
thought about who the other customers of these farmers were and whether 
they were all Jewish refugees. Probably most of them would have been 
Jewish refugee families.

the Protestant family in fact that rented us, no, they were not the 
owners, forget it, yes, they were also tenants. So we paid rent to a man 
named Pissini, who was of Italian descent, and he seemed",neutral,0.535643994808197,4

comfort. But it was freedom of a certain kind. And we, we were there. And 
that becomes a little, so that's when we came, for every vacation, winter 
vacation, summer vacation, every time we could escape for a second. 

So then we abandoned Saint-Etienne and we all go up to, to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
except for my father, I guess, who continued his job. And, 
and I guess, we're there, and I have private lessons so I won't lose a

Department of Haute Loire in the Massif Central had come up already. 
There was already some discussion there whether to send me to a school 
that was in the village. Then, now in late November, early December, this 
became a more pressing question for the people looking after me and the 
decision was taken, to move me to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, but it was too 
dangerous to move me at that time. The roads were being watched by the 
Germans and by the police. There were all kinds of passes, identity paper

about 2 o'clock in the morning or something like that and was met by a 
man named Daniel Trocme. He was the cousin, I believe, or the nephew, I'm 
not sure, as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the

the hill. So, I now find myself in this home together with about 15 or so 
kids in this home. Daniel Trocme was our shepherd who looked after us. He 
was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late 
twenties. He looked after us and the entire village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few 
years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire village apparently 
was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that village are

were or whether you were Jewish or not or what have you. They took you 
in. They fed you. You never had a situation of people saying, well, I 
wish I could help you but we don't have an empty bed or no, they opened 
up their doors and they shared what little they had. I always liked to, 
when I tell about Le Chambon-sur-Lignon to Americans, I try to make them 
understand that European farm villages, the farming community is quite 
different from the American one in that the people of the village live 
clustered, very close together, one house next to the other, there's no

activities would be interrupted by suddenly someone saying, ah, we're 
going to go into the woods for a hike and at the time, I didn't know the 
reason why and this is something that I found out later on, periodically 
the police would tip off people in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and tell them 
we're coming up there at 10 o'clock to round up or look for Jews or look 
for people that are hidden up in your village, get them out. So, they 
didn't tell us the reason, they just told us, we're going to go and pick 
mushrooms in the woods or if it wasn't mushrooms season or we're going to 
go for a nature hike, a little walk and",fear,0.8925531506538391,2

remarkable. Daniel Trocme by the way is one of the very very few people 
that was arrested by the Germans and sent to a concentration camp and 
killed because the Germans simply could not believe that an Arian, a non-
Jew would do what Daniel had done and so he is one of the very few people

Huguenots fled to America to what later became the United States. But the 
French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and 
the ancestors of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon managed to clamber 
up on this mountainous plateau and it was the beginning of the winter and 
the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there. 
Nobody can live up there anyhow. But they survived and in their church

really didn't click with any group and this French boy, Amede Dutoit was 
his name, he was even more of a loner than I was than I was and I think 
that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously. 
But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably 
brought up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon because they thought that the 
mountain air would be good for him and in those days people with TB were 
sent to sanatoria in the mountains and so forth and so that's probably 
what brought him up there.

very close ties with Pastor Trocme. Trocme, before the war, had been a

some historians who have looked into the past, into the history of

central mountain chain in France. Sort of isolated on a desolate plateau, 
very cold in the winter, windswept plateau. Agriculture was pretty 
rudimentary. 
But what made this village unusual was that in the country, that is 90% 
or 95%",fear,0.5328889489173889,2

they risked not only arrest for themselves, but for the members of their 
family, their children, expropriation of their property, and so on. So it 
was a great risk, personal risk, that these people did this. 
Well, they saved, during the war years, 5,000 people were sheltered in 
that village in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and in the surrounding villages.  Perhaps 
their act was inspired also by memories of the suffering and the 
persecution that the Protestants suffered during the Reformation period, 
when the Protestants were being massacred, literally massacred by the 
thousands by, in Catholic France. 
And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to school, to a ",fear,0.6154690980911255,2

she would have a job for me. During the summer time, I could take care of 
Pastor Trocmé's children and in the fall, I could go to school. So my

wasn't very happy to leave my parents, but I went to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon

and there I was received by Paster Trocmé and I, my job was to 
take care of the children, to help in the household, and to do anything 
else that was necessary. And that's what I did. 

The main, the main thing was there were four, four children. The Trocmé's 
had four children. One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so 
actually Nellie wa",joy,0.5647551417350769,3
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ness, about the lots to do in the Trocmé house and it was 
true. It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was quiet 
and thoughtful and completely changed.  
 
I didn't know about their plans at all. One day, however, Mother Trocmé 
told me that they intended to have children come from the Camp de Gurs 
and that when they are in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, they would want me to go 
there in, into the same house to help with the children because the 
children would not know French. A lot, a lot of the children would not 
know French, and they wanted me to help with the children. Would I do 
that?  And I said, ""Of course.""  And then, also, one thing happened that 
made, did, it was very strange. They",fear,0.6605973839759827,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"financially, the Trocmé's had to have 
boarders. And when they, they gave her a lot of work.  

I didn't move around in town. I didn't. I was with the children or in the 
house. I never moved around town. And then when I was in the house with 
the other, the house was called La Guespy. If you want to come to that 
period now that I was first in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon during the summer. 
Right?  And then when the school started, I moved to La Guespy. And when 
I came to La Guespy, the children from Gurs were, had already arrived, I 
think a day or 2 before. And there was a room for the girls and a room 
for the boys. Was very, very small. Very small and crowded. So I was in 
the girls' room. And there my task w",fear,0.6160992383956909,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"te. These children had just left their parents, and they were in a 
situation where they hardly knew where they were. They, they did not 
understand where they were. They knew they were somewhere in France 
without their parents. They had come from Germany. They had arrived in 
Gurs in, in the camp. They, they had been transported from Gurs to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And, and they had no idea where they were and what 
they were there for. So, you, you had to, to hold their hands. That's 
what it was. You, you had to hold their hands because they were alone. 
All of them. Each one of them. Then I was told I should go to school and 
I was glad to go to school. There was only one other person who could go 
to sc",fear,0.47309792041778564,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"y and it, I must say, we 
were supported wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the Secours 
Suisse. They gave the money. Those two organizations. If it weren't for 
the American Quakers and the Secours Suisse, they could not have had 
enough money to establish the house.

This is a page of my autography book which I started the day I left 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And it says, ""To our very dear Elizabeth.""  And it is 
signed by all the children and the lady who took care of the children, 
Mademoiselle Usach, while Madame Trocmé had a special page on another 
page.  All the children signed this page and one of the children made the 
drawing.  It shows somebody leaving for the United States.  It says 
""Ameri",neutral,0.4250740110874176,4

is somebody trying to save himself in the middle, ""S.O.S.""  And going to 
America where I think life seems much greener.  
﻿My name is Elizabeth Koenig. 

And amongst it was a, a request by the Trocme family for me to contact 
the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the 
Quakers had given their support to the Le Chambon-sur-Lignon Project and 
to, and Pastor Trocme was entirely dependent on their financial help.

Because it's, it's a most unusual story. The, that a whole village, in 
fact I think it's the only time an entire region, an entire region 
decided not to cooperate with the power in, of the government, to oppose 
the government in, in such a threatening situation ",fear,0.929103434085846,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"n, of the government, to oppose 
the government in, in such a threatening situation to them, their own 
lives.  Not such a single person. That happened very often. Not just a 
single family or two or three devoted citizens but an entire village and 
their neighbors. 

In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village 
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon spared and we never had really an answer and I 
don't think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred 
percent. But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and 
put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didn't 
know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released. And of course 
he jumped fr",fear,0.9762795567512512,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"s theory was is because he was so young, he 
was 12 years at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn't 
at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young 
children were brought into concentration camps. It was because the mayor 
of the city had written to Petain saying that the children, the Jewish 
children of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon have, are under the protection of the 
Swiss. Secours Suisse. And therefore cannot be touched. He had never 
received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They 
must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left.

get a job, earn a living, and so on, or something. And she learned that 
in a place far away, and nobody had heard of, they were looking for a

I believe Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is unique in the history of the Holocaust, because 
the, I know of no other place in the world where a whole village united 
to help as many people as possible. And, the numbers vary between 2000 
and 5000 of refugees they helped. And I would tend to say it's probably 
in between and more towards 3000, but I do not think that that has, is of

especially helping children and the combined, this tradition combined, 
I'm afraid I have to cut this short because I cannot tell you more about 
this marvelous tradition of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. But, the background 
made them unique to help the refugee children and my teacher, my Latin 
teacher, Hilda Hoefert, found that the pastor himself needed an Au Pair 
girl, and had asked her to write to me if I would take that 
responsibility. So I was supposed to go there in the beginning of the 
summer, especially to take care of the children wh",fear,0.929394006729126,2

activity. They had no activities during the summer months.  

Oh, yes, I went. Then I, when I came back from Toulouse, I went to my 
parents and I, and they said, Now you, you, you better go and see Hilde 
Hoefert and, and we wish you good luck, essentially. And so I left for, 
to go to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and, and went to the pastor's house, and I became a 
member of his family virtually, and took care of his children. And he had 
four children. He had, his oldest child was Nelly, and Nelly was already 
14, and I didn't have to take care of her, and the next one was Jean 
Pierre, and he was 12, and he sort of refused to be taken care of. And, 
but ",neutral,0.2993955612182617,4

rescue activities, but, of course, I wasn't knowledgeable about the 
details, but, and, but in the evening, he was always home and we had 
prayer in common and, and he's, he, he did, he was very devoted to his 
family.

Now, in, excuse me, I have to say this, this, for what happened in Le 
Chambon-sur-Lignon. When in the fall, Pastor Trocme brought a whole lot of children 
from the concentration camps. He, he had people go into concentration 
camps and ask the parents whether he could take their children to where 
it is safe for them. And just like my parents agreed, these parents 
agreed too. So he had a whole lot of children that had come from the

Chambon-sur-Lignon. And so he opened up a house which was called La Guespy, and he 
put these children there, boys, girls, small, older, a whole group of 
children, and not all of them were from concentration camps. Some were 
also French orphans, for instance, and so on. And he founded this house 
for the rescue of these children. Then he came to me, and he said,

sending coded messages to the Resistance here in France. It's very exciting! We have 
newspapers here, too, so for the first time since we've been in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, we can follow the 
news of the war. Usually, at La Guespy, we have no idea what's going on in the world. I wonder 
how Mutter and Vater are.

Mutter and Vater are gone. They took everyone away. Hanne just got back from Gurs. She got 
permission to go there to visit her mother. When she got there, they were deporting everyone.

Jewish. Some of them were non-Jewish. And so it was myself and one half-Jewish 
fellow. He, we went back to the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. They brought us back, the 
doctor. 
I was too young. I was maybe half a year too young. And the other one was half 
Jewish.  So now I said to myself, well, it's time I do something. But meanwhile, 
where I'm gonna stay? I can't stay in the village now. It is impossible.

my mother that as safe as Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is, we need to get out. 
We need to get out of the country. And I told my friends and I told the 
young people in the student home Les Roches. There were some friends of 
my husband there; there was a map on the wall and I said, ""You see where 
we are here and this is where we have to go,"" pointing to Switzerland, 
and they looked at me like I had",fear,0.6042554974555969,2

When I came back from Gurs and the short stop I made to see my then 
boyfriend obviously  having  seen  my  mother  deported  and  the  last  
thing  I  saw  of  her  was  a  white handkerchief fluttering out of the 
cattle car. I don't know whether you can. No, you cannot understand what 
emotions you are going through, and I came back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their 
parents had been deported at the same time. And within, I don't know 
whether it, I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days 
later but it doesn't really matter. There was a get together and I 
believe, I cannot be sure anymore, it might have been in the",fear,0.7791908383369446,2

everything else was wiped off the slate. So,  he was angry with me. I 
learned that afterwards. And it really didn't matter. 
 
Well, this was a couple of days later when I told them this is what we 
will have to do. Well on my way back, as I mentioned, I saw my boyfriend. 
I told him to come up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon if things become difficult 
where he is because I was sure that there would be help, that he would be 
safe. And he did come. And he told you how he found me on the way walking 
from one house to the other. And wait a minute. Now I have to think a 
moment. I lost my thought. Excuse me. What did we do? Oh. Yeah. When I

Because they existed, too. 

You know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a 
little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon on 
my life is that it really, it happened twice. It happened at my birth; 
but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these 
people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really 
changed my life. And I really feel that they rescued me twice.

And that girl, which was very friendly with me from the school, she took 
me to like a farm. And the name of the town, the little town was Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
But I remember the farm, it was in the middle of greenery, 
and it was like, you know, I don't know what, exactly what they were 
doing. It was a farm. They were making cheeses. They were making wines,

But the head of the Quakers said, oh, we have so many volunteers coming 
in the camps, but what we miss would be a village who ",neutral,0.5150376558303833,4
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ers said, oh, we have so many volunteers coming

those who are rescued from the camp, because it is dangerous, and the 
people do not want to take them in. Is your village ready to do such a 
thing? Then my husband came back, and it was decided that the people 
could come in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And so the first house was opened, and it was called Les Grillons, the 
crickets. And in that house was a cousin of my husband who came. He was a 
teacher.

He was a teacher in a very well-known French school, a high school, a 
private high school, and he felt that he could do something better during 
the war. And he asked my husband if he neede",fear,0.26425623893737793,2

All at once, Hanne had to go away from Gurs, and Max was remaining there. 
But Max had the hope to go in a Jewish house that was a kind of place 
where some Jewish boys could be hidden, and then hid in another place, 
like a transit place, a transition.

But not immediately, not as soon as Hanne. And Hanne came to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and she corresponded with Max. One day she heard that the 
people of the camp of Gurs were moving, and they were taken to Germany 
again.

This meant destruction, this meant Auschwitz and all the other terrible 
camps. So she asked permission to go and say goodbye to her mother, and 
she left, and she went down to Gurs. And she arrived just in ti",fear,0.6858023405075073,2

of his friends, who came out of Gurs, refused. They said they were a Jew, 
but didn't have the Jew religion.

And then, a few weeks afterwards that Hanne had been there, they were 
sent away by those rabbis. They said, if you want to go away, go. You can 
go where your friend Hanne is.

You can go to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon if you want, you can go where you 
want. But we do not give you your papers back, you know. It was very 
complicated, as a matter of fact.

In the meanwhile, Hanne was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. She did not know 
that Max would come one of those days. One evening, Max and a friend

didn't see anything. Now the village is much bigger, and you have lights 
all over the place.

So they did not know where to stop. Happy that it was summer, they just 
laid down near a house, and they slept. In that time, there was a kind of 
danger to stay in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And the children of the young people of La Guespy had been brought around 
in farms. And put here and there. But that evening, they came back and 
they slept there.

And the next morning, when Hanne opened the door to go out, what did she 
see? Max was there, with his friend. Can you imagine?

Max was there with his friend. What could she do? Sh",fear,0.4107334017753601,2

He could come in for a visit, but there was no more room for him. Nothing 
was decided for him. Nothing was provided for him.

Next door lived Mrs. Andre Philip. You heard about Philip. Philip was a 
very, very helpful person.

She did a lot. And she also had organized a way to go to Switzerland. Oh, 
she has been one of the top people in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and also 
elsewhere.

And her husband has been an important man. He went to England and he went 
to North Africa. And afterwards he was a minister in the new regime after 
the war.

So Mrs. Philip started to look around where to put Max. And we never knew

And she did not know what we were doing. As a matter of fact, Hanne came 
late back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon after having visited her mother. And 
my husband scolded her and was a little mad against her because she had 
not written or said that she was coming later.

And the young girls, 17 years old or 18 perhaps at that time, running 
around, it was dangerous being a Jew and being hidden. And then she told 
me, you know, your husband was such a wonderf",fear,0.5162153840065002,2

problem of Max. A few days afterwards, oh no, the same day I think it 
was, the same day he was taken by somebody far away in a farm.

But he didn't know where. And he still doesn't know where. And he still 
doesn't know the name of those people.

He knows a little bit the direction. South, east perhaps from 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. He didn't know.

He walked for some one hour and one hour and a half. And then came into a 
farm. And these people in the farm had only one girl.

The girl was going to school. She was perhaps 12 or 13. He was probably 
18.

And the people said to him that he was welcome. But he would stay in the 
hay all day long. Shut up there without coming do",neutral,0.4498721659183502,4

I think it was a nice story. One day, somebody came and took him away. 
And Madame Philip had organized a kind of railroad hiding place to go 
through the mountains and to go to Switzerland.

So he left for Switzerland. And the central France has high mountains. 
Not so high as the Alps.

But the mountain near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is 1,600 meters. So it's high 
enough. But then you have to go down to the valley of the Rhône, far 
away.

And then you have to climb the other side. And there are the pre-Alps. 
And then you have the Alps.

So it was a very difficult job to bring people there.

Some other people had organized a way to go to Spain also. And to go to 
Geneva, some",fear,0.3635607063770294,2
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"and. And she had some far away cousins in Switzerland.

So she could get a little money, she could get a little kind of 
invitation to cross the place. But she didn't want to go into the group, 
but she didn't want to go with a crowd, or with organized traveling. 
She's a very independent girl.

So she told to the people who were helping her in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
she told to her organization where she was. The head of the house knew 
it. My husband knew it.

Everybody knew it. But she left, and she went to Tence. This is a nearby 
little city, and eight kilometers only far from there.

But she didn't take the road. She went to the woods, not to be seen. And 
when she arrived there, she had enough money t",neutral,0.3968328833580017,4
Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"oney to take the bus.

She took a bus, and went down the road valley. And then from one house to 
the other, she arrived to the border where her family, friends, were 
waiting for her. And she had no difficulty to cross the border, because 
she had some papers from those people.

Chambon-sur-Lignon, who had been, who was the son of a woman that I had

Chambon-sur-Lignon as farmers, as farmers, farmers, and in the village. 
People who were essentially poor and also poorly dressed, whose lifestyle 
and eating habits were probably poor. I remember them not being a 
handsome people, people who, there was a lot of rickets, for instance, 
not enough fruit, not enough vitamin C. A lot of people had bad teeth

because their teeth remained unattended. A lot of people had goiters 
because of the type of water we had in that area. So I remember them as 
people who seemed quite primitive, as if from the Middle Ages, still 
carried over from the Middle Ages.

My father was invited there to be the minister of the Protestant church 
in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  He was looking for a new church. They were 
looking for a minister, and although they didn't go all the way with his 
pacifist convictions, they said they would accept him because they 
appreciated his way of thinking. He was known as a sort of a rebel 
because he was a pacifist and a nonviolent person. And you know that the

Oh, yes, of course, I was aware that Jews were arriving. Well, I realize 
that because, it is because they were refugees that they are arriving. I, 
and mind you, there were other refugees too, who were not Jewish, who 
were people from cities who are looking for a safe place.

It was not a matter of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon reacting to 
the arrival of the refugees. People arrive, are looking for a place to 
stay, and one person knows the other, decides, well, maybe I can help 
them out. It was not an invasion of refugees and people reacted 
positively or negative. Each person reacted to one individual case at a 
certain moment when help was needed.

we had only one successful raid that took place in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
Usually when there was going to be some kind of a raid, it was a raid 
that came from Le Puy and somehow the police, you know, the Tom Tom of 
the jungle, would warn.  There was some phone call, or somebody would 
call the town hall, or somebody who would call someone from the

longer able to do so and they also took on 40 children.  That is, the 
children's aid society provided the financing, had the responsibility, 
chose the children, and so we had a fairly large center in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  
At the end we had around 200 children in the village. That was the situation. 

Now in 1942, the persecutions began, and we experienced them as well.

were about our children.  He reassured us that it was just about paper 
control, they always said that.  That was on August 23.  Two days later, 
we experienced another situation.  At 4 a.m., our house, L'Abric, was 
surrounded by eight policemen who w",fear,0.7539005875587463,2

in danger, to L'Abric House in order to better protect them.  They were 
sleeping in the dining room and were found by the police.  The leader of 
the house search was a French Colonel from Corsica and the Chef de La 
Sûreté des Departements.    
 
So, the two chief officers led the action in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and 
they now ascertained that the children's papers were in order.  We always 
had papers that were accepted by the Mairie, that is, by the mayor's 
office, even if they may have contained occasional inaccuracies and 
corrections, periods around birth dates, etc.  The papers were in order 
and yet they weren't certain.  Although they w",fear,0.9452044367790222,2

farms and others, in a kind of ladder from one to another, got into 
Switzerland, that was done largely by the citizenry under the guidance of 
the wife of André Philip, the later d'Ecole Minister of Interior.   
 
She was responsible for organizing this in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and that 
was nice. The entire village worked together.  We did a little, but the 
citizenry participated and that pleased us.  It was a real experience. 
The police remained in the village another four weeks.  They brought in 
police dogs to search the forests.  They threatened the two pastors, and 
the three aid organizations received",fear,0.6791706681251526,2

even that helped.  The time passed, and they left after four weeks and 
not one of the 72 refugees was taken away.  On the first day, they had us 
under surveillance in La Guespy (one of the homes).  They had taken Mr. 
Steckler to Le Puy, but on the second day, I was able to free him in Le 
Puy and take him back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was a victory for 
us, for all who had stood up for the refugees, for the children, but also 
the adults, and a common victory for the work of those who were there for 
the children such as the citizenry, the church ministers.  So, these were 
some impressions from 1942. 
 
The Huguenots were a minority.  They had to defend thems",anger,0.26234936714172363,0

in a war situation, one must not quarrel over objective truth. The 
Huguenots had to defend themselves.  In that area, even earlier, they had 
taken in workers' children during the summer vacations from St. Etienne.  
Then, during the Spanish Civil War, they took in Spanish refugees.  It 
had become a tradition in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and for that reason we 
were able to carry out this mission together.  The further expansion, 
that the Swiss Red Cross, Children's Aid, as it was called in 1942, came

had a room ready for Mrs. Forestier where she could talk with him and 
they brought him in.  I saw him myself with the marks on his face, he 
had been beaten, he had blue marks, and I saw that.  Mrs. Forestier 
spent about ten or 15 minutes with her husband, and then we all returned 
to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was shortly, I know it was a week or ten 
days, before the liberation.    

Le Puy was liberated on August 19, 1944, and just before and shortly 
thereafter, I'm not exactly sure, the prisoners were sent north. We later 
learned that he never made it beyond Lyon, and that there he was in 
Barbie's (Klaus Barbie, the ""butcher"" of ",fear,0.48039793968200684,2

They had come from Valence and were about 40 kilometers from Chambon-sur-Lignon 
with a small tank group, and already they had begun shooting at 
houses.  We worried about the children, and we got together in the 
village, what should we do?  I still remember the date, it was July 9, 
1944.  We decided to designate Le Chambon-sur-Lignon as an open city for 
children.   

That was made evident by the large number of children's homes, so we 
could declare the city as an open city.  Then I also pointed out that

children.  There were about 800 children who were in Chambon-sur-Lignon 
between 1941 and 1944 and who took something with them from their 
experiences in Chambon-sur-Lignon.  So, that was something about this 
period.  Thank you. 

I spoke earlier about the 25th of August in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
""L'Abric.""  That was a spectacular action for us, and we were happy about 
that, but we were still worried.  We were very careful, and organized an 
alarm system.  The distance from one house to another was still about two 
kilometers.  So mornings, we knew that the police began their work 
around 4 a.m.  Someone was always prepared, ",fear,0.3703601360321045,2

We also had a cook from the north who had come south with a very tall, 
lean young man.  He was a Canadian, had been in Dunkirk with his company, 
and had missed the ship. She had concealed him, and then taken him 
through the demarcation line as a deaf-mute nephew.  She learned that it 
might be possible to find work and lodging in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and 
they eventually came to us through the pastor.  We needed a cook, and the 
young man worked for us as a handyman.  He did housework, shopped for 
food, repaired vehicles, shoes, furniture, etc.  Naturally, whenever 
German or French police came, we had to hide him.  There were also some 
children who had to be hidden.  We had a bo",fear,0.6246875524520874,2

five Swiss, and all the others were people from many different nations.  
One could talk at least another hour about their various life stories.  
But we were happy that we could set the course in the right direction and 
that we were able to prevent a deportation.  This was true both for my 
wife in Rivesaltes as well as for us later in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  The 
number, how many, is difficult to say, but at the time, there, we could 
realize that they remained here because of our help.  What else? 

There were also many Catholic families who helped.  I had said that at

So they rented it, we rented it, and we had a place to go to in the 
summer with my governess, because my parents didn't come the whole time. 
And Le Chambon-sur-Lignon had other families, refugees from Paris, who 
also were there, and kids. And I remember that almost every day, I was 
visited by some of these kids who lived in the village, Jewish girls, to 
play Monopoly.

We played Monopoly almost every day. And I didn't really like that girl

with a dozen eggs and a pound of butter, you know. I don't know that they 
were identifying me as Jewish. I never thought of it as being anti-
Jewish, as I say. But they must have known that we were because who else 
came begging for food from Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I don't know. I haven't 
thought about who the other customers of these farmers were and whether 
they were all Jewish refugees. Probably most of them would have been 
Jewish refugee families.

owners, forget it, yes, they were also tenants. So we paid rent to a man

comfort. But it was freedom of a certain kind. And we, we were there. And 
that becomes a little, so that's when we came, for every vacation, winter 
vacation, summer vacation, every time we could escape for a second. 

So then we abandoned Saint-Etienne and we all go up to, to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,

decision was taken, to move me to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, but it was too 
dangerous to move me at that time. The roads were being watched by the

about 2 o'clock in the morning or something like that and was met by a 
man named Daniel Trocme. He was the cousin, I believe, or the nephew, I'm 
not sure, as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the 
village, Andre Trocme, and we had a long long walk in a cold night and

kids in this home. Daniel Trocme was our shepherd who looked after us. He 
was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late 
twenties. He looked after us and the entire village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few 
years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire village apparently 
was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that village are

remarkable. Daniel Trocme by the way is one of the very very few people 
that was arrested by the Germans and sent to a concentration camp and 
killed because the Germans simply could not believe that an Arian, a non-
Jew would do what Daniel had done and so he is one of the very few people

Huguenots fled to America to what later became the United States. But the 
French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and 
the ancestors of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon managed to clamber 
up on this mountainous plateau and it was the beginning of the winter and 
the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there. 
Nobody can live up there anyhow. But they survived and in their church

really didn't click with any group and this French boy, Amede Dutoit was 
his name, he was even more of a loner than I was than I was and I think 
that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously. 
But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably 
brought up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon because they thought that the 
mountain air would be good for him and in those days people with TB were 
sent to sanatoria in the mountains and so forth and so that's probably 
what brought him up there. 
 
I think that my being sent away came in conjunction with Daniel Trocme's

I remember correctly, they had all been wounded on the Russian front and 
so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want 
to have trouble with anybody. They pretty much kept to themselves and 
some historians who have looked into the past, into the history of 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, think that that may also be one of the reasons why 
there was no problem. These soldiers had gone through hell on the Russian 
front. They didn't want to start hunting Jews or anybody else, just leave 
me alone. Everyday that I can stay away from duty on the front somewhere, 
so much the better. So, I had no trouble.

We're looking at a postcard that was taken probably in the late 1930s of 
a house which is marked Pension De Famille. It was a boarding house or a 
bed and breakfast, if you will. And that house, a solid house built of 
rocks, the Les Grillons, the home where I lived from the time that I 
arrived in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the beginning of 1943, until I left 
in late 1943, it was called Les Grillons. And Daniel Trocme was the den 
father, I guess you would call it, who looked after us in that house. 

Here is a group shot taken in front of Les Grillons. You can see the 
building in the back. This is a picture probably of all the kids who were

Monday, February 1, 1943 ﻿So by late December, December 31, I was notified that I would be shipped 
off to another location. And I was put on a train. And on New Year's Eve, 
they explained to me that there would be fewer patrols and police out, 
checking people's, traveler's papers, identity papers. And I was told to 
get off at a place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
And I arrived at about 4 o'clock in the morning. 3:00, 3:00 or 4 o'clock 
in the morning. It was a bitter, cold night. And I was met there by a 
young man named Daniel Trocme, who then took me, and we had a very, very

farmhouse called Les Grillons, the crickets, F",fear,0.4238736033439636,2

It is located at about 3,000 feet elevation in the Massif Central, in the

very cold in the winter, windswept plateau. Agriculture was pretty 
rudimentary. 
But what made this village unusual was that in the country, that is ",fear,0.4399672746658325,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ause what they were doing was illegal. If caught, 
they risked not only arrest for themselves, but for the members of their 
family, their children, expropriation of their property, and so on. So it 
was a great risk, personal risk, that these people did this. 
Well, they saved, during the war years, 5,000 people were sheltered in 
that village in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and in the surrounding villages.  Perhaps 
their act was inspired also by memories of the suffering and the 
persecution that the Protestants suffered during the Reformation period, 
when the Protestants were being massacred, literally massacred by the 
thousands by, in Catholic France. 
And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to sc",fear,0.642187237739563,2

I had this place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which was actually the 
resort above Saint-Etienne, and no more than about 50 kilometers up, 
maybe not even so much, and is became really the saving, during the war 
because I mean, you could always go there and, and put the children

They were Jewish kids. That was a big story in itself. When you read 
Phillip Hallie's book and you read about Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, Le 
Chambon-sur-Lignon is a very well known place of mine, because my kids 
were hidden there at one time. What happened with Pastor Trocme, you see,

Nobody. 
 
And people have done crazy things. A couple of my friends, they are here 
today, but his brother, they took him a week or ten days before the end. 
They had everything planned. It was fantastic. They were in an apartment 
near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and they had two entrances. They had an 
obvious entrance with that number on the door, and they had a back 
entrance that nobody could find because it was going through another 
house into another apartment and not connected at all with this one. And 
somebody knocked at the door and impulsively he went to the door. He had

is no way. All I say is that if the war had last only for another six 
months, we could no longer go, because we changed our name so many time. 
We changed our location so many times. We changed everything about 
ourselves. You could no more hide yourself. It was getting impossible. 
Yeah. I put my children in, I told you once about Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I 
mean, if you ever go to the museum, the Holocaust museum in Washington, 
you'll see a very good display of what Chambon-sur-Lignon was. 
It was a little village up above Saint-Etienne, about 15 miles away. The 
head of that village was a famous pastor, a Protestant pastor by the name 
of Trocme. He and his wife and the children live",fear,0.42475414276123047,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," saved, and 
you're not going to denounce them. 
And I'm telling you something. We have no weapon. We have nothing to 
defend them. We can't defend ourselves. All we have are the weapons of 
our spirit. And it's going to have to act so that each and every one of 
you feel that it's his duty to do something. And 5,000 villagers hid 
5,000 Jews. 
So Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was a fantastic place. And there was a little, tiny 
children boarding school there. And my children were there many times. 
Every time, something was wrong, every time I wasn't sure what was going 
to happen, I would bring them up there. ﻿I received, through, again, Tracy Strong, influence, documents of

occupied the camp. And we went to the railway station in Perpignan. And we were 
not bothered by the Germans. We made our way back to Chambon-sur-Lignon. And it was kind of 
risky on the train with the troops coming the other way, the German troops, and 
French police going the other way. But we made it to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
And in Chambon-sur-Lignon, the second time again we were hidden. But this time, preparations 
were made to get us false identity papers, to get us exit visa from France, to 
get us Swiss immigrant, immigration visas which we couldn't get on the spot, but 
we had to pick up in en masse in near the Swiss border on the French side. We

And one day we received a letter from our...the lady who was my Latin 
teacher, who had gone into a village to become a German teacher, and she 
wrote me and my father, parents a letter saying that as things do not 
look too well.  When the letter came, the teacher said that she would

she would have a job for me. During the summer time, I could take care of 
Pastor Trocmé's children and in the fall, I could go to school. So my

and there I was received by Paster T",sadness,0.34216681122779846,5

take care of the children, to help in the household, and to do anything 
else that was necessary. And that's what I did. 

The main, the main thing was there were four, four children. The Trocmé's 
had four children. One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so

true. It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was quiet 
and thoughtful and completely changed.  
 
I didn't know about their plans at all. One day, however, Mother Trocmé 
told me that they intended to have children come from the Camp de Gurs 
and that when they are in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, they would want me to go 
there in, into the same house to help with the children because the 
children would not know French. A lot, a lot of the children would not 
know French, and they wanted me to help with the children. Would I do 
that?  And I said, ""Of course.""  And then, also, one thing happened that

boarders. And when they, they gave her a lot of work.  

I didn't move around in town. I didn't. I was with the children or in the 
house. I never moved around town. And then when I was in the house with

period now that I was first in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon during the summer. 
Right?  And then when the school started, I moved to La Guespy. And when 
I came to La Guespy, the children from Gurs were, had already arrived, I 
think a day or 2 before. And there was a room for the girls and a room 
for the boys. Was very, very small. Very small and crowded. So I was in 
the girls' room. And ther",fear,0.6153792142868042,2

situation where they hardly knew where they were. They, they did not 
understand where they were. They knew they were somewhere in France 
without their parents. They had come from Germany. They had arrived in 
Gurs in, in the camp. They, they had been transported from Gurs to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And, and they had no idea where they were and what 
they were there for. So, you, you had to, to hold their hands. That's 
what it was. You, you had to hold their hands because they were alone. 
All of them. Each one of them. Then I was told I should go to school and 
I was glad to go to school. There was only one other person who coul",fear,0.3899649977684021,2

were supported wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the Secours 
Suisse. They gave the money. Those two organizations. If it weren't for 
the American Quakers and the Secours Suisse, they could not have had 
enough money to establish the house.

This is a page of my autography book which I started the day I left 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And it says, ""To our very dear Elizabeth.""  And it is 
signed by all the children and the lady who took care of the children, 
Mademoiselle Usach, while Madame Trocmé had a special page on another 
page.  All the children signed this page and one of the children made the 
drawing.  It shows somebody leaving for the United States.  It s",neutral,0.5121084451675415,4

And amongst it was a, a request by the Trocme family for me to contact 
the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the 
Quakers had given their support to the Le Chambon-sur-Lignon Project and 
to, and Pastor Trocme was entirely dependent on their financial help.

Because it's, it's a most unusual story. The, that a whole village, in 
fact I think it's the only time an entire region, an entire region 
decided not to cooperate with the power in, of the government, to oppose 
the government in, in such a threatening",fear,0.8300289511680603,2

the government in, in such a threatening situation to them, their own 
lives.  Not such a single person. That happened very often. Not just a 
single family or two or three devoted citizens but an entire village and 
their neighbors. 

In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village 
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon spared and we never had really an answer and I 
don't think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred 
percent. But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and 
put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didn't 
know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released. And of course 
h",fear,0.9775340557098389,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," his theory was is because he was so young, he 
was 12 years at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn't 
at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young 
children were brought into concentration camps. It was because the mayor 
of the city had written to Petain saying that the children, the Jewish 
children of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon have, are under the protection of the 
Swiss. Secours Suisse. And therefore cannot be touched. He had never 
received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They 
must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left.

I'm afraid I have to cut this short because I cannot tell you more about 
this marvelous tradition of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. But, the background 
made them unique to help the refugee children and my teacher, my Latin 
teacher, Hilda Hoefert, found that the pastor himself needed an Au Pair 
girl, and had asked her to write to me if I would take that 
responsibility. So I was supposed to go there in the beginning of the

uniform to wear. That was my disguise. I had been in the Boy Scouts while I was in 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, but I didn't have a uniform, they were too expensive. Jean-Pierre, Pastor Trocme's 
son, and Marco Darcissac, the son of the schoolmaster, took me by bicycle all the way down the

to the Le Chambon-sur Lignon, which is, was a haven for a lot of Jewish

So this is when you separated from your parents? 
That's right, and from my brother. 
It was not easy for me. It was very hard for them. They knew this might be

And also, I tried to get my parents out of Gurs at that time. 
Well, I had, I had, I knew, I know, knew quite a few people, including some

And he said to me, I'll do anything I can to get your parents out. And it was 
maybe a week or two just before they were deported. They, they were supposed 
to come about two weeks after to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. Yes. Well they were deported on 
August 1943, I believe it was. I have, have it inside. That was, must have 
been 1943, right. So while we are at the, at this carpenter shop, so we went

But meanwhile, and some other names were called. And some of them were half 
Jewish. Some of them were non-Jewish. And so it was myself and one half-Jewish 
fellow. He, we went back to the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. They brought us back, the 
doctor. 
I was too young. I was maybe half a year too young. And the other one was half 
Jewish.  So now I said to myself, well, it's time I do something. But meanwhile, 
where I'm gonna stay? I can't stay in the village now. It is impossible.

or another. Being that they were German Gentiles who had fled into France 
because of political reasons. People who had become Protestant but were 
of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth, we had a 
friend like that. She was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and she was in a 
Protestant home. We had all sorts of people. The number of 5000 is the 
accepted number today by the papers, the false papers that were issued in 
the village and the surrounding area. People came, stayed, got their 
papers, went on. Because once they had the false identification papers, 
especially with the French Jew",anger,0.33580127358436584,0

opportunity to survive. It's tremendous. There were no 5000 people 
surviving in hiding in Germany, Jewish people. I think the number 
is 2000, but I'm not quite sure. So think of what one village did or one 
village and the surrounding villages, what they did in comparison to 
others. It is enormous. 
 
When I came back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon from seeing my mother in Gurs, 
I told some of his friends who were in a American funded student home, 
and told them, told my friends that we had no longer any parents, that 
they were taken away. It was a horrible job. It was a horrible mission, 
really. The whole situation was incredible. And I told some of his 
friends, ""We have to ",fear,0.9088433980941772,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"id, ""Okay, then I'm 
crazy, but that's where I'm going to go."" Guess who went first? The ones 
who called me crazy. They went way before I did. I only went in February 
of 1943. I told my husband at the time I saw him, on that Boy Scout farm, 
Jewish Boy Scout farm, run by two rabbis incidentally, that if he felt he 
was not safe there, to come to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which he did, 
together with another young fellow. And I took him to Madame Philip, the 
wife of André Philip, who was the right hand man to General de Gaulle. 
And she asked me only one question, ""Can we trust him?"" And I said, ""Of 
course you can."" And by evening he had been hidden away. He was hidden 
away for four weeks. He didn't ",fear,0.7941818833351135,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ges than any of us did. Because all of a 
sudden she no longer had the support group, of the group, of the group 
who was in the same situation, you know. But she's, you know, she's 
suffered really psychological damages to this day. Well, there is 
Elizabeth Koenig, nee Kauffman, she was with us. She did not come from 
Gurs, but she came to us in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. There is Wiltrud 
Lavell, nee Eanee. There is Jack Lewin. There is Rudy Appel, who was not 
originally from Gurs, but came from Rivesaltes. The Atlas boys.  

I had made up my mind after I saw my mother being deported that I was not 
going to stay in France, no matter how safe in Chambon-sur-Lignon. I just 
felt, and I had family in, i",fear,0.3784443438053131,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,". I went alone from Chambon-sur-Lignon, which I left on foot 
to go to the next village, because I did not want anyone in the village 
to see me take the train. This way I just disappeared. I stayed one night 
with the minister in Tence, which is the next little town. And the, in 
the morning I took the train, from there to go to Saint-Etienne.
In Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert 
us, right? That was an absolute taboo. Would have been very easy for 
these people to persuade us, right? Absolutely not. I have asked many of 
my friends how they felt about it and it was the same opinion.

We arranged",fear,0.9579832553863525,2

try to get up to her village, because while she didn't know what was 
really going on there, she felt they would help. And so the young fellow 
was much younger, was a few years younger than I and I, I said to him, 
""I'm going to join Hanne or to try to find Hanne,"" and so the next 
morning we set out and went up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. We arrived at,
Hanne had told me how to get there, so that was not a problem. And the 
problem was that in, I arrived there in the middle of the night, it was 
at 10 or 11 o'clock, now where am I going to find my girlfriend? So we 
came somewhere, which turned out later to be a tennis court, in, in, in 
what looked to us like a wood an",fear,0.5371053218841553,2

I understand, Hanne was asked, ""Can we trust him?"" So she explained 
that, ""Yeah, he is my boyfriend, he comes from Gurs like I did,"" and they 
put me up for the next night in the villa. People were very nice, they 
fed me. And the following evening, I was taken to a farm somewhere in the 
outreaches of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I don't know to, to this day the 
name of the farm family who took me in. These farm houses are very small. 
They had, this farm house had only two bedrooms. So the farmer put me 
up in the grange. So I was sleeping in the hayloft. And the man was very 
practical, the first thing he did was, he took his saw and he cut a hole 
into the ",fear,0.41168442368507385,2

thing they did is they photographed me. They explained to me, ""We will 
get you false papers now and then we will help you to escape to 
Switzerland."" And I think there were four of us who went to, who were 
helped escape to Switzerland, I think we were the first group, because we 
went by railroad from Le Chambon-sur-Lignon to a village in the French 
Alps. 
 
When we left Chambon-sur-Lignon, we were given ins, explanations that we 
should find Protestant ministers. If you can't find the Protestant 
minister, go to the Catholic local priest. So I went to the church.

known 10 minutes ago that they would help, because it's a question didn't 
come up. You know, they did this for religious reasons, for moral ",fear,0.6496062874794006,2

able to work in a photo store, being that I came out of this line of 
business. And then this was rejected. Maybe they felt I would be too 
exposed in an open store. And I took a job as a maid in a preventorium 
that was just outside of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. We had there children 
with TB and children who were in danger of getting TB and I worked there 
for several months until, in fact, I went down to Gurs to see my mother. 
The object was to make a little money. In the bargain, I learned French.  
 
Well,  I  sort  of  helped  taking  care  of  the other children,  yes.

armoire and so eventually they left and we could come out. So we were 
very, very lucky. And four weeks later, we came back to the village. The 
razzias had stopped for the moment and it also helped me to make up my 
mind. Even before that actually, when I came back from Gurs after I saw 
my mother that as safe as Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is, we need to get out. 
We need to get out of the country. And I told my friends and I told the 
young people in the student home Les Roches. There were some friends of 
my husband there; there was a map on the wall and I said, ""You see where 
we are here and this is where we have to go,"" pointing to Switzerland, 
and they looked at me",fear,0.6068137884140015,2

When I came back from Gurs and the short stop I made to see my then 
boyfriend obviously  having  seen  my  mother  deported  and  the  last  
thing  I  saw  of  her  was  a  white handkerchief fluttering out of the 
cattle car. I don't know whether you can. No, you cannot understand what 
emotions you are going through, and I came back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their 
parents had been deported at the same time. And within, I don't know 
whether it, I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days 
later but it doesn't really matter. There was a get together and I

everything else was wiped off the slate. So,  he was angry with me. I 
learned that afterwards. And it really didn't matter. 
 
Well, this was a couple of days later when I told them this is what we 
will have to do. Well on my way back, as I mentioned, I saw my boyfriend. 
I told him to come up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon if things become difficult 
where he is because I was sure that there would be help, that he would be 
safe. And he did come. And he told you how he found me on the way walking 
from one house to the other. And wait a minute. Now I have to think a

Swiss border who would literally take me across the border. I made my way

Gervais, in the French Alps. There a 10 year old boy picked us up, 
brought us to the home of his father. We met there a, a young Protestant 
minister who was supposed to go with us when we would cross the mountains 
to learn the route so that he would help people later on go the same 
route.  
 
And we had been told in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon already that if we need 
help we should look for a Protestant minister. If there's no Protestant 
minister, go to the Catholic priest. They probably will help you.

And we arranged at that point that if I would get into trouble, since Le

weeks later I was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And I arrived there after we 
were denied help, when help was needed in the middle of the night. Where

in France to arrest Jews. And I got a little note from her that she was 
well; she was, she was on a farm, I shouldn't worry. Shortly thereafter, 
I was picked up, brought back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon where I found my

We had been explained in France, in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, that if we

French pastors, go to the Catholic Church, Protestant ministers. If we 
couldn't find Protestant ministers, go to the Catholic Church.

Heritier, who played a very important role in the life of the village,

component in what went on there.  People",neutral,0.5908366441726685,4
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," to which we are shaped, shaped by early 
influences, that in on some deep level, I was probably very much 
influenced by the Heritiers as a baby and as an infant. I was actually 
left with the Heritiers for a certain period of time when my parents were 
busy.  And Eva, when my parents were in Saint-Étienne a near-by town they 
Eva took me back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  And I stayed with her and her 
parents, you know, for a period of time. 

Eva Heritier, who was the Heritiers' daughter, who was, went with my 
parents when they went to Saint-Étienne. My mother asked to take Eva with 
her to help her out, which was a big deal for the Heritiers. Their 
daughter going to the big city.  And they trusted",fear,0.35874059796333313,2

symbolism of that actually, because they trusted my parents to take their 
daughter away with them to the big city. Trust ends up going both ways.  
But at one point, Eva took me back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, just her 
alone.  And I stayed with her parents and with her.  Madame Heritier 
mentions the fact that that's where I learned to walk. Apparently, my 
first steps were taken under their auspices. And, you know, it was very

community.  Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, 
such as the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, to which I am increasingly 
devoting part of my life. And perhaps particularly this: as we come to 
attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall 
into a trap. The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to 
consider that all this was so, they were so few in number that they're

gentiles of the Holocaust.  And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust. 
Because they existed, too. 

You know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a 
little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon on 
my life is that it really, it happened twice. It happened at my birth; 
but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these 
people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really 
changed my life. And I really feel that they rescued me twice.

But the head of the Quakers said, oh, we have so many volunteers coming 
in the camps, but what we miss would be a v",neutral,0.531525731086731,4

in the camps, but what we miss would be a village who accepts to take 
those who are rescued from the camp, because it is dangerous, and the 
people do not want to take them in. Is your village ready to do such a 
thing? Then my husband came back, and it was decided that the people 
could come in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And so the first house was opened, and it was called Les Grillons, the 
crickets. And in that house was a cousin of my husband who came. He was a 
teacher.

He was a teacher in a very well-known French school, a high school, a 
private high school, and he felt that he could do something better during 
the war. And he asked my husband ",fear,0.29908424615859985,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"uld, and they liked each other. 
All at once, Hanne had to go away from Gurs, and Max was remaining there. 
But Max had the hope to go in a Jewish house that was a kind of place 
where some Jewish boys could be hidden, and then hid in another place, 
like a transit place, a transition.

But not immediately, not as soon as Hanne. And Hanne came to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and she corresponded with Max. One day she heard that the 
people of the camp of Gurs were moving, and they were taken to Germany 
again.

This meant destruction, this meant Auschwitz and all the other terrible 
camps. So she asked permission to go and say goodbye to her mother, and 
she left, and she went down to Gurs. And she arrived",fear,0.6473010778427124,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"m to go to the Jewish services. And he and one 
of his friends, who came out of Gurs, refused. They said they were a Jew, 
but didn't have the Jew religion.

And then, a few weeks afterwards that Hanne had been there, they were 
sent away by those rabbis. They said, if you want to go away, go. You can 
go where your friend Hanne is.

You can go to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon if you want, you can go where you 
want. But we do not give you your papers back, you know. It was very 
complicated, as a matter of fact.

In the meanwhile, Hanne was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. She did not know 
that Max would come one of those days. One evening, Max and a friend 
arrived in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

So he walked in that direction, and then there was no light anymore. He 
didn't see anything. Now the village is much bigger, and you have lights 
all over the place.

So they did not know where to stop. Happy that it was summer, they just 
laid down near a house, and they slept. In that time, there was a kind of 
danger to stay in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And the children of the young people of La Guespy had been brought around 
in farms. And put here and there. But that evening, they came back and 
they slept there.

And the next morning, when Hanne opened the door to go out, what did she 
see? Max was there, with his friend. Can you imagine?

Max was there with his friend. What could",fear,0.3096635937690735,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"im 
in.

He could come in for a visit, but there was no more room for him. Nothing 
was decided for him. Nothing was provided for him.

Next door lived Mrs. Andre Philip. You heard about Philip. Philip was a 
very, very helpful person.

She did a lot. And she also had organized a way to go to Switzerland. Oh, 
she has been one of the top people in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and also 
elsewhere.

And her husband has been an important man. He went to England and he went 
to North Africa. And afterwards he was a minister in the new regime after 
the war.

So Mrs. Philip started to look around where to put Max. And we never knew 
what she was doing. Never.

And she did not know what we were doing. As a matter of fact, Hanne came 
late back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon after having visited her mother. And 
my husband scolded her and was a little mad against her because she had 
not written or said that she was coming later.

And the young girls, 17 years old or 18 perhaps at that time, running 
around, it was dangerous being a Jew and being hidden. And then she told 
me, you know, your husband was suc",fear,0.5843891501426697,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," against her. So Mrs. Philip took the 
problem of Max. A few days afterwards, oh no, the same day I think it 
was, the same day he was taken by somebody far away in a farm.

But he didn't know where. And he still doesn't know where. And he still 
doesn't know the name of those people.

He knows a little bit the direction. South, east perhaps from 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. He didn't know.

He walked for some one hour and one hour and a half. And then came into a 
farm. And these people in the farm had only one girl.

The girl was going to school. She was perhaps 12 or 13. He was probably 
18.

And the people said to him that he was welcome. But he would stay in the 
hay all day long. Shut up there withou",neutral,0.4562806785106659,4
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"g. He was a guest. He was a refugee.

I think it was a nice story. One day, somebody came and took him away. 
And Madame Philip had organized a kind of railroad hiding place to go 
through the mountains and to go to Switzerland.

So he left for Switzerland. And the central France has high mountains. 
Not so high as the Alps.

But the mountain near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is 1,600 meters. So it's high 
enough. But then you have to go down to the valley of the Rhône, far 
away.

And then you have to climb the other side. And there are the pre-Alps. 
And then you have the Alps.

So it was a very difficult job to bring people there.

Some other people had organized a way to go to Spain also. And to go to 
G",fear,0.43813732266426086,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"erland. And she had some far away cousins in Switzerland.

So she could get a little money, she could get a little kind of 
invitation to cross the place. But she didn't want to go into the group, 
but she didn't want to go with a crowd, or with organized traveling. 
She's a very independent girl.

So she told to the people who were helping her in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
she told to her organization where she was. The head of the house knew 
it. My husband knew it.

Everybody knew it. But she left, and she went to Tence. This is a nearby 
little city, and eight kilometers only far from there.

But she didn't take the road. She went to the woods, not to be seen. And 
when she arrived there, she had eno",fear,0.38678327202796936,2
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"aiting for her. And she had no difficulty to cross the border, because 
she had some papers from those people.

And one who had been, another one who was also there, that house in 
Chambon-sur-Lignon, who had been, who was the son of a woman that I had 
for two years in my house. Imagine. And she never spoke of her son.

I knew he was somewhere in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. But I didn't want to 
know where. It was not necessary to speak of things.

It was not necessary. Everybody did what they had to do for that day. 
Very often I'm asked, what was your problem?

How did you decide things? Nothing was decided. Every day, we had to do, 
to resolve the problem that just came.

Perhaps it was a good way of r",neutral,0.5412535667419434,4
Le Chambon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"nd he had his wife who could sew. So 
she took my sewing machine and for I don't know how many, perhaps two 
years, I don't remember how long they were there, she was sewing all the 
time for people and making some money and he was babysitting, they had a 
second child, they had a first child they brought with them, and a second 
child they had in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And the doctor was babysitting 
and doing the cooking and doing the washing while his wife was sewing.

We had a quantity of foreigners coming in. Some of them we knew about 
some of them just came out of there some of them knew other people. I 
don't know, you know, we say we call that the Arab telephone.

It means from year to year y",neutral,0.5413005948066711,4

It means from year to year you hear that there is a place where there is 
not much danger and when people can offer hospitality. And what has 
helped a lot also was that in our village and the villages all around the 
ancestors of those people are Huguenots old Huguenots so all those 
stories were in the population of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon when they got a 
minister like my husband who was a conscientious objector who was not

was a conscientious objector not because they were sharing his ideas

but he says that he gave out something like between 5 and 6 thousand 
false cards so he says that people who were rescued, doesn't mean they 
were 6 thousand but meant that he gave and other people gave other cards 
they came from many different places you see but he says that he thinks 
that perhaps around 5 thousand Jews had been rescued by Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
but how long they were rescued when they left you don't know what 
happened afterwards so you cannot say when you rescue somebody that he 
was rescued for all his life and when they ran away from a camp or from a 
place they do not consider themselves rescued they jump from one place to 
the other but in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon it was a ",neutral,0.5118906497955322,4

many of them remained.

she went to Argentina and she realized that they were looking for her in 
Marseille somebody had phoned from Marseille perhaps but this I know it.

Surely we knew danger but we never thought of it in this way we were 
involved in problems and the problems had to be solved and everybody was 
in danger we were in danger too the governor had come to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
had said to my husband that if he did not give the names of the 
Jews who were there he would be arrested himself so we knew it perfectly 
well so surely we knew but everybody was in danger even those who were 
with weapons the Maquis also was in danger surely

if I had been married to a elementary school teacher or even a college 
teacher in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon I could not have done what I did because 
it was the stature of minister's wife in such a place, in such a moment 
and people came to the parish house to the parish house because they knew 
there was such a preacher and so on so they thought maybe it's going to 
be better there than in another place

severe but anyhow he had such principles and for what should be honestly

from his father some not very much but anyhow once I met the banker who 
came to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon once a week and he told me Mr. Trocmé could 
have a little bit money if he wanted to collaborate but he doesn't change

was not free and then Paris was free the war ended then it was at the

Oh, yes, of course, I was aware that Jews were arriving. Well, I realize 
that because, it is because they were refugees that they are arriving. I, 
and mind you, there were other refugees too, who were not Jewish, who 
were people from cities who are looking for a safe place.

It was not a matter of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon reacting to 
the arrival of the refugees. People arrive, are looking for a place to 
stay, and one person knows the other, decides, well, maybe I can help

we had only one successful raid that took place in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

that came from Le Puy and somehow the police, you know, the Tom Tom of

People didn't talk about their experiences prior to arriving in

were able to withstand the winter quite well.  There were times when we 
were cut off, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is about 1000 meters high, on a high

were about our children.  He reassured us that it was just about paper

surrounded by eight policemen who wanted to co",fear,0.6839679479598999,2

in danger, to L'Abric House in order to better protect them.  They were 
sleeping in the dining room and were found by the police.  The leader of 
the house search was a French Colonel from Corsica and the Chef de La 
Sûreté des Departements.    
 
So, the two chief officers led the action in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and 
they now ascertained that the children's papers were in order.  We always 
had papers that were accepted by the Mairie, that is, by the mayor's 
office, even if they may have contained occasional inaccuracies and 
corrections, periods around birth dates, etc.  The papers were in order 
and yet they weren't certain.  Although they weren't on t",fear,0.9439115524291992,2

that, all the help, so that some of these children could be hidden in the 
farms and others, in a kind of ladder from one to another, got into 
Switzerland, that was done largely by the citizenry under the guidance of 
the wife of André Philip, the later d'Ecole Minister of Interior.   
 
She was responsible for organizing this in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and that 
was nice. The entire village worked together.  We did a little, but the 
citizenry participated and that pleased us.  It was a real experience. 
The police remained in the village another four weeks.  They brought in 
police dogs to search the forests.  They threatened the two pastors, and 
the three aid organizations received a letter (",fear,0.6862756609916687,2

even that helped.  The time passed, and they left after four weeks and 
not one of the 72 refugees was taken away.  On the first day, they had us 
under surveillance in La Guespy (one of the homes).  They had taken Mr. 
Steckler to Le Puy, but on the second day, I was able to free him in Le 
Puy and take him back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was a victory for 
us, for all who had stood up for the refugees, for the children, but also 
the adults, and a common victory for the work of those who were there for 
the children such as the citizenry, the church ministers.  So, these were 
some impressions from 1942. 
 
The Huguenots were a minority.  They had to defend themselves, and ",anger,0.2636742889881134,0

in a war situation, one must not quarrel over objective truth. The 
Huguenots had to defend themselves.  In that area, even earlier, they had 
taken in workers' children during the summer vacations from St. Etienne.  
Then, during the Spanish Civil War, they took in Spanish refugees.  It

to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, was thanks to Pastor (André) Trocmé.  He looked 
beyond France's borders, had connections to the American Quakers, to 
Swedish aid organizations, to the reconciliation alliance, to the YMCA.  
That was also represented in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  Pastor Trocmé made 
connections with the Swiss aid society and extended that.  And so, the 
aid society went beyond the local and national and that provided a kind 
of energy.  The people could see: ""We are not alone.  The others will 
also come and help us.""  And that is the complete background, the total 
atmosphere in which we were able to op",joy,0.47460412979125977,3

had a room ready for Mrs. Forestier where she could talk with him and 
they brought him in.  I saw him myself with the marks on his face, he 
had been beaten, he had blue marks, and I saw that.  Mrs. Forestier 
spent about ten or 15 minutes with her husband, and then we all returned 
to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  That was shortly, I know it was a week or ten 
days, before the liberation.    

Le Puy was liberated on August 19, 1944, and just before and shortly 
thereafter, I'm not exactly sure, the prisoners were sent north. We later 
learned that he never made it beyond Lyon, and that there he was in

They had come from Valence and were about 40 kilometers from Chambon-sur-Lignon 
with a small tank group, and already they had begun shooting at 
houses.  We worried about the children, and we got together in the 
village, what should we do?  I still remember the date, it was July 9, 
1944.  We decided to designate Le Chambon-sur-Lignon as an open city for 
children.   

That was made evident by the large number of children's homes, so we 
could declare the city as an open city.  Then I also pointed out that

children.  There were about 800 children who were in Chambon-sur-Lignon 
between 1941 and 1944 and who took something with them from their 
experiences in Chambon-sur-Lignon.  So, that was something about this 
period.  Thank you. 

I spoke earlier about the 25th of August in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
""L'Abric.""  That was a spectacular action for us, and we were happy about 
that, but we were still worried.  We were very careful, and organized an 
alarm system.  The distance from one house to another was still about two 
kilometers.  So mornings, we knew that the police began their work 
around 4 a.m.  Someone was always prepared, and we care",joy,0.38121649622917175,3

We also had a cook from the north who had come south with a very tall, 
lean young man.  He was a Canadian, had been in Dunkirk with his company, 
and had missed the ship. She had concealed him, and then taken him 
through the demarcation line as a deaf-mute nephew.  She learned that it 
might be possible to find work and lodging in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and 
they eventually came to us through the pastor.  We needed a cook, and the 
young man worked for us as a handyman.  He did housework, shopped for 
food, repaired vehicles, shoes, furniture, etc.  Naturally, whenever 
German or French police came, we had to hide him.  There were also some 
children who had to be hidden.  We had a boy, Serge, w",fear,0.6133551597595215,2

five Swiss, and all the others were people from many different nations.  
One could talk at least another hour about their various life stories.  
But we were happy that we could set the course in the right direction and 
that we were able to prevent a deportation.  This was true both for my 
wife in Rivesaltes as well as for us later in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  The 
number, how many, is difficult to say, but at the time, there, we could 
realize that they remained here because of our help.  What else? 

There were also many Catholic families who helped.  I had said that at 
the Christmas celebration, it always went further, and the entire action 
was not just a Protestant action.  The OSE (French-Jewis",joy,0.9566992521286011,3

it was really a beautiful view, and just marvelous countryside. Somewhat 
mountainous, but the central mountains, not the Alps or anything.

So they rented it, we rented it, and we had a place to go to in the 
summer with my governess, because my parents didn't come the whole time. 
And Le Chambon-sur-Lignon had other families, refugees from Paris, who 
also were there, and kids. And I remember that almost every day, I was 
visited by some of these kids who lived in the village, Jewish girls, to 
play Monopoly.

We played Monopoly almost every day. And I didn't really like that girl 
that she knew, I didn't like her, but she showed up every day.  But ",joy,0.7557836771011353,3

having stuff to sell, I don't know, but we did. So we did, we'd come back 
with a dozen eggs and a pound of butter, you know. I don't know that they

Jewish, as I say. But they must have known that we were because who else 
came begging for food from Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I don't know. I haven't

they were all Jewish refugees. Probably most of them would have been

the Protestant family in fact that rented us, no, they were not the 
owners, forget it, yes, they were also tenants. So we paid rent to a man 
named Pissini, who was of Italian descent, and he seemed",neutral,0.6119661331176758,4

on holidays, and, you know, again, not very much food, not very much 
comfort. But it was freedom of a certain kind. And we, we were there. And 
that becomes a little, so that's when we came, for every vacation, winter 
vacation, summer vacation, every time we could escape for a second. 

So then we abandoned Saint-Etienne and we all go up to, to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
except for my father, I guess, who continued his job. And, 
and I guess, we're there, and I have private lessons so I won't lose a

There was already some discussion there whether to send me to a school

became a more pressing question for the people looking after me and the 
decision was taken, to move me to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, but it was too 
dangerous to move me at that time. The roads were being watched by the

about 2 o'clock in the morning or something like that and was met by a 
man named Daniel Trocme. He was the cousin, I believe, or the nephew, I'm 
not sure, as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the

the hill. So, I now find myself in this home together with about 15 or so 
kids in this home. Daniel Trocme was our shepherd who looked after us. He 
was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late 
twenties. He looked after us and the entire village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few 
years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire village apparently 
was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that village are

Huguenots fled to America to what later became the United States. But the 
French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and 
the ancestors of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon managed to clamber 
up on this mountainous plateau and it was the beginning of the winter and 
the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there. 
Nobody can live up there anyhow. But they survived and in their church

that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously. 
But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably 
brought up to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon because they thought that the 
mountain air would be good for him and in those days people with TB were 
sent to sanatoria in the mountains and so forth and so that's probably 
what brought him up there.

forgers to come with a false document, false identity papers and so 
forth. And as I mentioned I think before, we were all given copies of 
these photographs. And whatever number of pictures we didn't actually use

﻿Monday, September 21, 1942 
I am sad and weary. During rest hour Mrs. Cavaillon called me. She 
received a letter asking whether she wanted to send some children to a very nice 
school in Haute-Loire at an elevation of one thousand meters.  She selected me 
and another boy. I'll be able to go there but she is afraid that perhaps I 
won't be saf",sadness,0.9720715284347534,5

Monday, February 1, 1943 ﻿So by late December, December 31, I was notified that I would be shipped 
off to another location. And I was put on a train. And on New Year's Eve, 
they explained to me that there would be fewer patrols and police out, 
checking people's, traveler's papers, identity papers. And I was told to 
get off at a place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. 
And I arrived at about 4 o'clock in the morning. 3:00, 3:00 or 4 o'clock 
in the morning. It was a bitter, cold night. And I was met there by a 
young man named Daniel Trocme, who then took me, and we had a very, very 
long walk through the night. And ultimately, I wound up in a, a stone 
farmhouse called Les Grillons, the crickets, French word ",fear,0.4682178199291229,2
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"for crickets. 
And there I found myself together with about 22 or 24 other kids, ranging 
in age from about six, seven, up to about 17 or 18, boys and girls. And 
Daniel Trocme was our, call it then, then father. He was the, 
our supervisor and the man who ran that particular home. 
Later on I found out that he was the cousin of the pastor of the 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, whose name was Andre Trocme. At first I didn't know where I was, 
what it was. I discovered later, especially after the war, many years 
after the war, that Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was a most unique village in France. 
It is located at about 3,000 feet elevation in the Massif Central, in the 
central mountain chain in France. Sort of isolated on a ",neutral,0.5780543088912964,4

It is located at about 3,000 feet elevation in the Massif Central, in the 
central mountain chain in France. Sort of isolated on a desolate plateau, 
very cold in the winter, windswept plateau. Agriculture was pretty 
rudimentary. 
But what made this village unusual was that in the country, that is 90% 
or 95%",fear,0.3407214283943176,2
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ause what they were doing was illegal. If caught, 
they risked not only arrest for themselves, but for the members of their 
family, their children, expropriation of their property, and so on. So it 
was a great risk, personal risk, that these people did this. 
Well, they saved, during the war years, 5,000 people were sheltered in 
that village in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and in the surrounding villages.  Perhaps 
their act was inspired also by memories of the suffering and the 
persecution that the Protestants suffered during the Reformation period, 
when the Protestants were being massacred, literally massacred by the 
thousands by, in Catholic France. 
And so I found shelter there. I, I was sent to school, to a ",fear,0.6272646188735962,2

I had this place called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which was actually the 
resort above Saint-Etienne, and no more than about 50 kilometers up,

And we actually had no contact that we're too far away because the less

from. 

They were Jewish kids. That was a big story in itself. When you read 
Phillip Hallie's book and you read about Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, Le 
Chambon-sur-Lignon is a very well known place of mine, because my kids 
were hidden there at one time. What happened with Pastor Trocme, you see, 
he was one of those who was getting people to come to him and ask for 
asylum. He was one of those who had found places to hide them. They were 
hidden in the village, hidden away from the village.",fear,0.4196140766143799,2

Nobody. 
 
And people have done crazy things. A couple of my friends, they are here 
today, but his brother, they took him a week or ten days before the end. 
They had everything planned. It was fantastic. They were in an apartment 
near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and they had two entrances. They had an 
obvious entrance with that number on the door, and they had a back 
entrance that nobody could find because it was going through another 
house into another apartment and not connected at all with this one. And 
somebody knocked at the door and impulsively he went to the door. He had

is no way. All I say is that if the war had last only for another six 
months, we could no longer go, because we changed our name so many time. 
We changed our location so many times. We changed everything about 
ourselves. You could no more hide yourself. It was getting impossible. 
Yeah. I put my children in, I told you once about Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. I 
mean, if you ever go to the museum, the Holocaust museum in Washington, 
you'll see a very good display of what Chambon-sur-Lignon was. 
It was a little village up above Saint-Etienne, about 15 miles away. The 
head of that village was a famous pastor, a Protestant pastor by the name 
of Trocme. He and his wife and the children lived, of cours",fear,0.41013866662979126,2

you're not going to denounce them. 
And I'm telling you something. We have no weapon. We have nothing to 
defend them. We can't defend ourselves. All we have are the weapons of 
our spirit. And it's going to have to act so that each and every one of 
you feel that it's his duty to do something. And 5,000 villagers hid 
5,000 Jews. 
So Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was a fantastic place. And there was a little, tiny 
children boarding school there. And my children were there many times. 
Every time, something was wrong, every time I wasn't sure what was going 
to happen, I would bring them up there. ﻿I received, through, again, Tracy Strong, influence, documents of 
liberation to go to Chambon-sur-Lignon in ",neutral,0.5631526112556458,4

French police going the other way. But we made it to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

were made to get us false identity papers, to get us exit visa from France, to

And one day we received a letter from our...the lady who was my Latin 
teacher, who had gone into a village to become a German teacher, and she 
wrote me and my father, parents a letter saying that as things do not 
look too well.  When the letter came, the teacher said that she would 
suggest that I come to where she is, which is Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and 
she would have a job for me. During the summer time, I could take care of 
Pastor Trocmé's children and in the fall, I could go to school. So my 
parents' decided this was a much better solution for their daughter and I 
wasn't very happy to leave my parents, but I went to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon 
and there I was received by Paster Trocmé and I",sadness,0.3012610971927643,5

and there I was received by Paster Trocmé and I, my job was to 
take care of the children, to help in the household, and to do anything 
else that was necessary. And that's what I did. 

The main, the main thing was there were four, four children. The Trocmé's 
had four children. One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so 
actually Nellie wa",sadness,0.5495508909225464,5

true. It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was quiet 
and thoughtful and completely changed.  
 
I didn't know about their plans at all. One day, however, Mother Trocmé 
told me that they intended to have children come from the Camp de Gurs 
and that when they are in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, they would want me to go 
there in, into the same house to help with the children because the 
children would not know French. A lot, a lot of the children would not 
know French, and they wanted me to help with the children. Would I do 
that?  And I said, ""Of course.""  And then, also, one thing happened that 
made, did, it was very strange. They",fear,0.6394181847572327,2
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"ve financially, the Trocmé's had to have 
boarders. And when they, they gave her a lot of work.  

I didn't move around in town. I didn't. I was with the children or in the 
house. I never moved around town. And then when I was in the house with 
the other, the house was called La Guespy. If you want to come to that 
period now that I was first in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon during the summer. 
Right?  And then when the school started, I moved to La Guespy. And when 
I came to La Guespy, the children from Gurs were, had already arrived, I 
think a day or 2 before. And there was a room for the girls and a room 
for the boys. Was very, very small. Very small and crowded. So I was in 
the girls' room. And there my task w",fear,0.5942031741142273,2

situation where they hardly knew where they were. They, they did not 
understand where they were. They knew they were somewhere in France 
without their parents. They had come from Germany. They had arrived in 
Gurs in, in the camp. They, they had been transported from Gurs to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And, and they had no idea where they were and what 
they were there for. So, you, you had to, to hold their hands. That's 
what it was. You, you had to hold their hands because they were alone.

were supported wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the Secours

the American Quakers and the Secours Suisse, they could not have had 
enough money to establish the house.

This is a page of my autography book which I started the day I left 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And it says, ""To our very dear Elizabeth.""  And it is 
signed by all the children and the lady who took care of the children, 
Mademoiselle Usach, while Madame Trocmé had a special page on another 
page.  All the children signed this page and one of the children made the 
drawing.  It shows somebody leaving for the United States.  It says

America where I think life seems much greener.  
﻿My name is Elizabeth Koenig. 

And amongst it was a, a request by the Trocme family for me to contact 
the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the 
Quakers had given their support to the Le Chambon-sur-Lignon Project and 
to, and Pastor Trocme was entirely dependent on their financial help.

Because it's, it's a most unusual story. The, that a whole village, in 
fact I think it's the only time an entire region, an entire region 
decided not to cooperate with the power in, of the government, to oppose 
the government in, in such a threatening situation ",fear,0.9311661720275879,2

the government in, in such a threatening situation to them, their own 
lives.  Not such a single person. That happened very often. Not just a

their neighbors.

was 12 years at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn't 
at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young 
children were brought into concentration camps. It was because the mayor 
of the city had written to Petain saying that the children, the Jewish 
children of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon have, are under the protection of the

factors together, to them, the Jews were the chosen people, that was one 
of their religious principles, and so to help Jews, and to help, was 
ingrained in them, almost in their beliefs and in their way of life, and 
I believe Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is unique in the history of the Holocaust, because 
the, I know of no other place in the world where a whole village united 
to help as many people as possible. And, the numbers vary between 2000 
and 5000 of refugees they helped. And I would tend to say it's probably 
in between and more towards 3000, but I do not think that that has, is of

because actually, that was, the place was known for, is to help children 
who had tuberculosis to regain their strength. So they had a tradition of 
especially helping children and the combined, this tradition combined, 
I'm afraid I have to cut this short because I cannot tell you more about 
this marvelous tradition of the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. But, the background 
made them unique to help the refugee children and my teacher, my Latin 
teacher, Hilda Hoefert, found that the pastor himself needed an Au Pair 
girl, and had asked her to write to me if I would take that 
responsibility. So I was supposed to go there in the beginning of the 
summer, especially to take care of the children wh",fear,0.9472631216049194,2

activity. They had no activities during the summer months.  

Oh, yes, I went. Then I, when I came back from Toulouse, I went to my 
parents and I, and they said, Now you, you, you better go and see Hilde 
Hoefert and, and we wish you good luck, essentially. And so I left for, 
to go to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and, and went to the pastor's house, and I became a 
member of his family virtually, and took care of his children. And he had 
four children. He had, his oldest child was Nelly, and Nelly was already 
14, and I didn't have to take care of her, and the next one was Jean

them. And sometimes I go down to the village and shop for food. I do cleanup work and fool 
around with the other kids. Now that there's snow, we make trains with the sleds and go down

French, and we understand enough French now to know what they're saying. We think they're

to come about two weeks after to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. Yes. Well they were deported on 
August 1943, I believe it was. I have, have it inside. That was, must have 
been 1943, right. So while we are at the, at this carpenter shop, so we went 
back at night. And we, they did a, we had our dinner. And then one, then all

said, here I am. And they said, well, you're too young. You go. Then they called 
my brother's name out. They took him back to Camp de Gurs. 
But meanwhile, and some other names were called. And some of them were half 
Jewish. Some of them were non-Jewish. And so it was myself and one half-Jewish 
fellow. He, we went back to the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. They brought us back, the 
doctor. 
I was too young. I was maybe half a year too young. And the other one was half 
Jewish.  So now I said to myself, well, it's time I do something. But meanwhile, 
where I'm gonna stay? I can't stay in the village now. It is impossible. 
So I went to my friend, Madame Philip. I said, where should I go? She says, ",fear,0.3606768548488617,2

When I got out, at my time, it was under the control of the French 
people. And this lady, her name was Mademoiselle Hirsch. That's why we 
saw her in France during our reunion, just recently.  She got us out. We 
were seven, seven children. We were approximately 16 years old, and we 
were brought by train to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and we were placed in a 
home by the Swiss Red Cross, the Secours aux Enfants, which means help 
for children. And that's where we met Pastor Trocme and his wife and his 
children and other people who were involved in helping Jewish refugees.

are capable of doing.

followed the bus, and he pleaded for us with the authorities, to let us,

still under age. I don't think I was. I was under 18. So he brought me 
back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in Dr. Le Forestier's car. He went, he 
followed the bus and tried to, plead to get the people out. He couldn't 
get anybody else out. The rest of them went to Gurs or somewhere else,

the 5000 were Christian people who were persecuted, okay, for one reason 
or another. Being that they were German Gentiles who had fled into France 
because of political reasons. People who had become Protestant but were 
of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth, we had a 
friend like that. She was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and she was in a

Jewish Boy Scout farm, run by two rabbis incidentally, that if he felt he 
was not safe there, to come to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which he did, 
together with another young fellow. And I took him to Madame Philip, the 
wife of André Philip, who was the right hand man to General de Gaulle. 
And she asked me only one question, ""Can we trust him?"" And I said, ""Of 
course you can."" And by evening he had been hidden away. He was hidden 
away for four weeks. He didn't know if any",fear,0.7985336780548096,2

who was in the same situation, you know. But she's, you know, she's 
suffered really psychological damages to this day. Well, there is

to go to the next village, because I did not want anyone in the village 
to see me take the train. This way I just disappeared. I stayed one night 
with the minister in Tence, which is the next little town. And the, in 
the morning I took the train, from there to go to Saint-Etienne.
In Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert 
us, right? That was an absolute taboo. Would have been very easy for

Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. In a train, regular trains, we went across that 
portion of France into the French Alps and we stopped, I don't remember 
the name of the place. One, I believe it was one stop before Saint 
Gervais, in the French Alps. There a 10 year old boy picked us up,

to learn the route so that he would help people later on go the same 
route.  
 
And we had been told in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon already that if we need 
help we should look for a Protestant minister. If there's no Protestant 
minister, go to the Catholic priest. They probably will help you.

probably, the people in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon that I probably feel 
closest to, besides, besides the Trocmé family, are Henri et Anne 
Heritier, who played a very important role in the life of the village, 
although nobody knew it at the time; because they were harboring the 
young Jew who was the forger for the village.  And that was a key 
component in what went on there.  People, Jews need",neutral,0.6232248544692993,4
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0," to which we are shaped, shaped by early 
influences, that in on some deep level, I was probably very much 
influenced by the Heritiers as a baby and as an infant. I was actually 
left with the Heritiers for a certain period of time when my parents were 
busy.  And Eva, when my parents were in Saint-Étienne a near-by town they 
Eva took me back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.  And I stayed with her and her 
parents, you know, for a period of time. 

Eva Heritier, who was the Heritiers' daughter, who was, went with my 
parents when they went to Saint-Étienne. My mother asked to take Eva with 
her to help her out, which was a big deal for the Heritiers. Their 
daughter going to the big city.  And they trusted.  It's an ",fear,0.34994250535964966,2

daughter going to the big city.  And they trusted.  It's an interesting 
symbolism of that actually, because they trusted my parents to take their 
daughter away with them to the big city. Trust ends up going both ways.  
But at one point, Eva took me back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, just her 
alone.  And I stayed with her parents and with her.  Madame Heritier 
mentions the fact that that's where I learned to walk. Apparently, my 
first steps were taken under their auspices. And, you know, it was very 
moving to me when she mentioned that. I don't know. I can't help 
wondering whether there isn't something faintly symbolic a",fear,0.3530373275279999,2

somehow, well, that's where I started to walk. 
 
I do feel a very, very, very special bond with those people and with that 
community.  Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, 
such as the people of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, to which I am increasingly 
devoting part of my life. And perhaps particularly this: as we come to 
attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall 
into a trap. The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to 
consider that all this was so, they were so few in number that they're 
not important. Because they w",joy,0.5365583896636963,3

books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous 
gentiles of the Holocaust.  And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust. 
Because they existed, too. 

You know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a 
little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon on 
my life is that it really, it happened twice. It happened at my birth; 
but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these 
people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really 
changed my life. And I really feel that they rescued me twice.

in the camps, but what we miss would be a village who ",neutral,0.47468775510787964,4

people do not want to take them in. Is your village ready to do such a 
thing? Then my husband came back, and it was decided that the people 
could come in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And so the first house was opened, and it was called Les Grillons, the 
crickets. And in that house was a cousin of my husband who came. He was a 
teacher.

He was a teacher in a very well-known French school, a high school, a 
private high school, and he felt that he could do something better during 
the war. And he asked my husband if he neede",anger,0.26877373456954956,0

All at once, Hanne had to go away from Gurs, and Max was remaining there. 
But Max had the hope to go in a Jewish house that was a kind of place 
where some Jewish boys could be hidden, and then hid in another place, 
like a transit place, a transition.

But not immediately, not as soon as Hanne. And Hanne came to 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and she corresponded with Max. One day she heard that the 
people of the camp of Gurs were moving, and they were taken to Germany 
again.

This meant destruction, this meant Auschwitz and all the other terrible 
camps. So she asked permission to go and say goodbye to her mother, and 
she left, and she went down to Gurs. And she arrived just in ti",fear,0.6591036319732666,2
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"m to go to the Jewish services. And he and one 
of his friends, who came out of Gurs, refused. They said they were a Jew, 
but didn't have the Jew religion.

And then, a few weeks afterwards that Hanne had been there, they were 
sent away by those rabbis. They said, if you want to go away, go. You can 
go where your friend Hanne is.

You can go to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon if you want, you can go where you 
want. But we do not give you your papers back, you know. It was very

In the meanwhile, Hanne was in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. She did not know 
that Max would come one of those days. One evening, Max and a friend 
arrived in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

arrived in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

So he walked in that direction, and then there was no light anymore. He 
didn't see anything. Now the village is much bigger, and you have lights 
all over the place.

So they did not know where to stop. Happy that it was summer, they just 
laid down near a house, and they slept. In that time, there was a kind of 
danger to stay in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

And the children of the young people of La Guespy had been brought around 
in farms. And put here and there. But that evening, they came back and 
they slept there.

And the next morning, when Hanne opened the door to go out, what did she 
see? Max was there, with his friend. Can you imagine?

Max was there with his friend. What could she do? Sh",fear,0.3675660490989685,2

He could come in for a visit, but there was no more room for him. Nothing 
was decided for him. Nothing was provided for him.

Next door lived Mrs. Andre Philip. You heard about Philip. Philip was a 
very, very helpful person.

She did a lot. And she also had organized a way to go to Switzerland. Oh, 
she has been one of the top people in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, and also 
elsewhere.

And her husband has been an important man. He went to England and he went 
to North Africa. And afterwards he was a minister in the new regime after 
the war.

So Mrs. Philip started to look around where to put Max. And we never knew 
what she was doing. Never.

And she did not know what we were doing. As a matter of fact, Hanne came 
late back to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon after having visited her mother. And 
my husband scolded her and was a little mad against her because she had 
not written or said that she was coming later.

And the young girls, 17 years old or 18 perhaps at that time, running 
around, it was dangerous being a Jew and being hidden. And then she told 
me, you know, your husband was such a wonderf",fear,0.532534658908844,2

problem of Max. A few days afterwards, oh no, the same day I think it 
was, the same day he was taken by somebody far away in a farm.

But he didn't know where. And he still doesn't know where. And he still 
doesn't know the name of those people.

He knows a little bit the direction. South, east perhaps from 
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. He didn't know.

He walked for some one hour and one hour and a half. And then came into a 
farm. And these people in the farm had only one girl.

The girl was going to school. She was perhaps 12 or 13. He was probably 
18.

And the people said to him that he was welcome. But he would stay in the 
hay all day long. Shut up there without coming do",neutral,0.45538103580474854,4
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"g. He was a guest. He was a refugee.

I think it was a nice story. One day, somebody came and took him away. 
And Madame Philip had organized a kind of railroad hiding place to go 
through the mountains and to go to Switzerland.

So he left for Switzerland. And the central France has high mountains. 
Not so high as the Alps.

But the mountain near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is 1,600 meters. So it's high 
enough. But then you have to go down to the valley of the Rhône, far 
away.

And then you have to climb the other side. And there are the pre-Alps. 
And then you have the Alps.

So it was a very difficult job to bring people there.

Some other people had organized a way to go to Spain also. And to go to 
Geneva, some",fear,0.4676930904388428,2
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"erland. And she had some far away cousins in Switzerland.

So she could get a little money, she could get a little kind of 
invitation to cross the place. But she didn't want to go into the group, 
but she didn't want to go with a crowd, or with organized traveling. 
She's a very independent girl.

So she told to the people who were helping her in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, 
she told to her organization where she was. The head of the house knew 
it. My husband knew it.

Everybody knew it. But she left, and she went to Tence. This is a nearby 
little city, and eight kilometers only far from there.

But she didn't take the road. She went to the woods, not to be seen. And 
when she arrived there, she had enough money t",neutral,0.3923756778240204,4
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"aiting for her. And she had no difficulty to cross the border, because 
she had some papers from those people.

And one who had been, another one who was also there, that house in 
Chambon-sur-Lignon, who had been, who was the son of a woman that I had 
for two years in my house. Imagine. And she never spoke of her son.

I knew he was somewhere in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. But I didn't want to 
know where. It was not necessary to speak of things.

It was not necessary. Everybody did what they had to do for that day. 
Very often I'm asked, what was your problem?

How did you decide things? Nothing was decided. Every day, we had to do, 
to resolve the problem that just came.

Perhaps it was a good way of resolving it",neutral,0.556247889995575,4
Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,45.06081,4.302941,961.0,"nd he had his wife who could sew. So 
she took my sewing machine and for I don't know how many, perhaps two 
years, I don't remember how long they were there, she was sewing all the 
time for people and making some money and he was babysitting, they had a 
second child, they had a first child they brought with them, and a second 
child they had in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. And the doctor was babysitting 
and doing the cooking and doing the washing while his wife was sewing.

We had a quantity of foreigners coming in. Some of them we knew about 
some of them just came out of there some of them knew other people. I 
don't know, you know, we say we call that the Arab telephone.

It means from year to year you hear that there is a place where there is 
not much danger and when people can offer hospitality. And what has 
helped a lot also was that in our village and the villages all around the 
ancestors of those people are Huguenots old Huguenots so all those 
stories were in the population of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon when they got a 
minister like my husband who was a conscientious objector who was not

was a conscientious objector not because they were sharing his ideas

that perhaps around 5 thousand Jews had been rescued by Le Chambon-sur-Lignon

Surely we knew danger but we never thought of it in this way we were

in danger we were in danger too the governor had come to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon
