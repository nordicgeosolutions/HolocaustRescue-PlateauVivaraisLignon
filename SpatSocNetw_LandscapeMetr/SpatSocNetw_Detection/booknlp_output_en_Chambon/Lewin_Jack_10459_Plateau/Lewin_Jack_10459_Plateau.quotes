424	709	408	408	I	0	'm there . Just let me get my feet on the ground . So I was in , we , so we got to this home from the Swiss Red Cross . And we , it was a very small house up in the Massif Central , in [ FRENCH ] . And we were received very nicely by the pastor , by a pastor 's wife , by the Swiss Red Cross , and from the villages , villagers . And so we , as we arrived , they made dinner for us as , as best as they could , even though it was , everything was rationed . And this was also in Vichy . It was part of Vichy , France . It was very , very special . Well , first I would like to say this . And when the second or third day we were in that village , there was a very rich lady with , her name was Madame de Felice . She owned a tremendous amount of land . And the home for the Swiss Red Cross was owned by her . And the , the , actually , the whole section was owned by her . It must have been about 300 , 400 acres of land . And she had tremendous apple orchards in her garden . And so she invited us down , us seven from Camp de Gurs , and to pick apples . It was around apple picking time . And she told us , I still see her there in front of us . She says , children , you can not eat the apples . You can pluck 'em

And I used to visit her almost every day . And , so one , but before Mr. Philip , who was also a professor of economics of the University of Lyon , he came one night , and he , OK , had a big chariot with with two wheels , bicycle wheels on it , of potatoes , which was illegal to , to buy and hoard 'em
1029	1607	1627	1627	They	116	'm gon na go to jail . So we all , we all packed up and went , and all took a big bag of potatoes and carried them to his house . But I always have to say , when I got out of Camp de Gurs , into this village , I only weighed about 80 , 90 pounds . And I was really skinny . I was like a string bean . But anyhow , then in , then they started a carpenter shop , which was organized by the Swiss Red Cross children 's help , with a , and the one who was in charge was a man with the name of Auguste Bohny . Somebody , he was just last year , he was honored by the B'nai B'rith here in New York . And we , he started this carpenter shop . And we , my brother and I , brother and I , who also came to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon , after a short while , and we worked there . And also , I tried to get my parents out of Gurs at that time . Well , I had , I had , I knew , I know , knew quite a few people , including some people who were with the Vichy regime . And they knew I was Jewish . But this fellow was with the , somehow he had something to do with the Vichy regime , but he was not anti - Jewish . And he said to me , I 'll do anything I can to get your parents out . And it was maybe a week or two just before they were deported . They , they were supposed to come about two weeks after to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon . Yes . Well they were deported on August 1943 , I believe it was . I have , have it inside . That was , must have been 1943 , right . So while we are at the , at this carpenter shop , so we went back at night . And we , they did a , we had our dinner . And then one , then all of a sudden , somebody came and says , the Milice Laval , which is the , Laval , Laval was the president of France , which was equivalent to the Gestapo , and the gendarmerie are looking for all Jewish people . You better start hiding . So there are several homes from the Swiss Red Cross . And we , we went . The , the , the , all the Jewish children , who were in that , this home , in this particular home , went over where this Mr. Bohny was . And he was a young man himself . He was n't older than 22 . But he was sharp . He took us in , and we slept on the floor . We slept all over the place . And all of a sudden , a knock at the door , and the gendarmerie and the Milice Laval came . And they were , they said , surrender all the Jewish children . So Mr. Bohny says , you ca n't do this . This is Swiss grounds . This is , belongs to the Swiss Red Cross . You 're

2651	2781	2645	2645	they	177	're too young . You go . Then they called my brother 's name out . They took him back to Camp de Gurs . But meanwhile , and some other names were called . And some of them were half Jewish . Some of them were non - Jewish . And so it was myself and one half - Jewish fellow . He , we went back to the village of Le Chambon - sur - Lignon . They brought us back , the doctor . I was too young . I was maybe half a year too young . And the other one was half Jewish . So now I said to myself , well , it 's time I do something .

3087	3927	3078	3078	she	52	're sitting round the table , and he put his gears out , and made my false identification . One was a , a identification card from the French government . The other one was from the Boy Scouts . So I was with two false identifications . My name was Jacques Levet . And I was born , my , my real birthday . But I was born in , which is in Alsace - Lorraine . So I finally became , I became , I had a different name . I was looking for it the other day . I ca n't find it . So , so I went back into hiding . And she says , you 'll hear from me . So meanwhile , the pastor 's son and the school superintendent 's son , were both Boy Scouts . We were both together in the Boy Scouts , same troop . So we , they rented a bicycle for me . And I had my knapsack and my uniform . And they took us , they took me down about 40 miles down the mountains into a village called , to a town named Valence . And there I was met by a lady . I do n't remember her name . And she took care of me for , for the weekend . And she took me to her brother , who was a pastor in another mountain village . And she took a , and then , it was a Monday she took us . She took me and another pastor who joined us there , took us to Grenoble , from Grenoble to Annecy . As a matter of fact , the French resistance in Le Chambon - sur - Lignon was very , very big too , which , but they had passive resistance there . This is the house called La Guespy . It means , what do you call it ? Wasp net , nest . And we were there were about 30 children , but seven or eight of us were of German Jewish origin or Polish Jewish origin . And we , this was by the , this home was run by the Swiss Red Cross for children 's help . And the land was owned by a Madam de Felice , who , whom I described before in a , in my conversation . And this is where I lived for about a year and a half . Le Chambon - sur - Lignon , who saved the 5,000 Jewish people , who were the , the one who was very involved with this was Pastor and Madam Trocme and Mr. Darcissac and Pastor Theis . The , this village is unique . As a matter of fact , there 's a film that has been made by Pierre Sauvage named Weapons of the Spirit . This is the picture where the seven of us children who came from Camp de Gurs to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon . This is also at the home of the Swiss Red Cross . We were , this was haven for us , because they got us out of Camp de Gurs . The lady in the middle is Mademoiselle Usach who was the directress of the home . She was a Spanish citizen at the time . And she 's the one , she came , she left Spain during the Civil War and came to France . These children are , to the left is Victor Atlas . I am next to him . And next to me is another Atlas . As it turns out , I do n't remember his first name . Then Mademoiselle Usach and the other one , the girl next to her is Lilli Brown . Her name is Feihan now . She lives in Washington , DC . The next one is , the other little girl is Hanne Liebmann . Her name was Hanne Hirsch . She lives here in Bayside , New York , and the fellow is Manfred , do n't remember his last name . That we came . Yeah , to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon . We were together for at least a year and a quarter . Oh his name is Manfred Goldberger . Now I remember . So we were close knit . This is me as a Boy Scout , leaving Le Chambon - sur - Lignon to go over the border to Switzerland . And I was very happy to leave , even though I left a lot of my friends behind .
