269	1615	256	256	He	62	'm not sure , as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the village , Andre Trocme , and we had a long long walk in a cold night and wound up finally in a house , in an old stone house called Les Grillons , which was a bed and breakfast - type house , okay , a pension , as they call it in French . He met me at the train station . Yes , he met me and picked me up at the train station but from the train station to Les Grillons was a good four or five kilometers . I mean , it was a long hike , up the mountain too , up the hill . So , I now find myself in this home together with about 15 or so kids in this home . Daniel Trocme was our shepherd who looked after us . He was a younger man , he was probably in his twenties , mid- to late twenties . He looked after us and the entire village of Le Chambon - sur - Lignon really is the full detail , as I did n't become aware of until a few years ago , of ten to fifteen years ago , but the entire village apparently was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that village are about 90 - percent Protestants , fundamentalist and people who , as they put it , lived the Bible , lived by the Bible and their pastor gave them the needed inspiration on the day that France fell and surrendered to the Germans by telling his congregation that it is the responsibility of every Christian to resist the occupier with the weapons of the spirit . That village has a total population of about five thousand people during the period of about three years , actually hid and saved five thousand people , almost on a one - on - one basis . These villagers never asked who you were or whether you were Jewish or not or what have you . They took you in . They fed you . You never had a situation of people saying , well , I wish I could help you but we do n't have an empty bed or no , they opened up their doors and they shared what little they had . I always liked to , when I tell about Le Chambon - sur - Lignon to Americans , I try to make them understand that European farm villages , the farming community is quite different from the American one in that the people of the village live clustered , very close together , one house next to the other , there 's no big yard , no acreage between them . The people look across the street , a narrow street usually , and if they see the lights going out in the living room across the street , they know perfectly well it is ten past nine and they know that they count in twenty seconds a light will go on on the second floor on the third window from the right and that 's the bedroom and the light will be on for three minutes and thirty seconds and then the light will go out so you know exactly what your neighbor is doing . You know his routine . You ca n't escape it . During that period , lights went on and rooms where lights were never on at night and lights stayed on in rooms way past the normal times and nobody ever reported this to the police , nobody ever betrayed anybody and that 's truly remarkable . And you must understand that the people did this , this did so knowing fully well that if the police were to find out , they would n't just arrest the person that they were hiding but they were subject to arrest as well as the entire family and their children . Confiscation of their property , of their goods and deportation to forced labor camps and so forth . So , what these people did , they did it at the risk of their own lives . So , I was hidden there for about ten months . During that period , they also saw to it that our education was not completely neglected . There was a school , Le CollÃ¨ge CÃ © venol , which had been created as a private school before the war and they saw to it that we went to school every day and that we get on with our education . It usually meant long hikes from the house where we lived down to the school and on the way back , we usually came back up with supplies in the village . It was difficult to get shoes . For example , Daniel Trocme would scrounge worn out old tires and he would cut up the old tires and make soles for sandals out of them and by putting holes into the tires and stringing rope through them , he would make sandals out of them . Something that is very fashionable these days , I see a lot of kids walking around with these black sandals . It was a rugged place . It was at about an elevation of about three thousand feet . The winters were very very cold . Lots of snow . Most of us had frostbite on the hands , on the fingers and on our toes . Partly because our clothing was n't really that adequate but it also had a lot to do with the fact that our food was inadequate . There was n't enough fat content in the food and most of us were deficient in a number of nutrients and so forth but just about everybody was frostbitten fingers or toes . During that period , there was an organization there , individuals who specialized in forging papers and so forth . Some of the local citizens , some of them were part of the group of refugees . In other words , either the people that they took in were not just children , they were also adults , some husbands and wives , there was even a German deserter from the German army that they had taken in . I had befriended him because he spoke German fluently so we would speak German together . He was a , I remember as very tall , pale looking , very soft- spoken , gentle type guy who must have been eighteen or something like that . He deserted them . He decided to desert . Anyhow , in order to make room for other people in need , there was a full underground railroad , if you will , operating and if they could pass somebody as a Frenchman , and send them out of the village to some other safe place , safe house , if you will , then they would do so because then they would have more room in the village to take on more new people that might be in need and since I spoke French fluently without the trace of an accent , ultimately I was given some French identity papers , false name , forged ration tickets , coupons that you had to have at the time and so forth and I was sent to a town called Figeac in the lot department as a boarding student . They tried to keep us busy first of all . Now during the school months , between walking to school , coming back with supplies , doing your homework , by the time you were finished , it was time to go to bed and get ready for the next day . Our stay occasionally would be interrupted , our activities would be interrupted by suddenly someone saying , ah , we 're
1667	1713	1649	1650	the police	59	're coming up there at 10 o'clock to round up or look for Jews or look for people that are hidden up in your village , get them out . So , they did n't tell us the reason , they just told us , we 're
1732	2467	1649	1650	the police	59	're going to go for a nature hike , a little walk and sometimes we would stay in the woods for six hours , eight hours or something like that and then we would come back to the house and everything was fine and dandy . We did n't know what was going on . During the summer months , there was a lot of hiking , a lot of tug of wars and games that were organized , occasionally , we would be visited by Pastor Trocme , Daniel 's relative . The Pastor was the inspiration and leader of this village and the groups in the house in which I was , was a very mixed group , there were boys and there were girls . Among them were some Spanish refugees still , children of Spanish parents , of Spanish origin whose parents obviously had fled Franco , Spain during or after the revolution and found themselves in France and were either orphans or were persecuted for one reason or other . There were some people from Czechoslovakia . There were some German Jews . There was a young Frenchman who I am sure was not Jewish . He may have been an orphan . I think he was an orphan . He became a very very good friend of mine . He died of TB up there . We were very close friends . So , it was a mix of people . There was an Italian woman who was the cook , who cooked for us and she had a daughter there also . Her daughter was there . I really do n't know why they were there , what the reason was . But , as I said , it was a very mixed group of nationalities . I collected a lot of photographs which I kept and practically all of these photographs were passport - type pictures that were taken by the people who were creating these false documents , these forged documents for us . But , they gave us an extra supply of pictures and when we learned that we might have to leave , we would start exchanging photographs and give a souvenir to our best friend by dedicating the photograph to him or her and so on . I was able to take a lot of these photographs with me which I should n't have but we 'll talk about that later maybe . But day flowed into day , occasionally I would inquire whether anything had been heard from my parents and by now , I think I came to the realization that there was a program afoot in France , Germany and so forth to deport Jews , deport them to Poland or east to extermination camps . The name Auschwitz , I had n't heard of it yet and so as time went on , let 's say that my hopes faded too and I just kept on . I was of course cut off from any other relatives at this point . I had no idea whether my grandmother , uncle and aunt had made it to the United States and if they did , I would n't know where or how to contact them . I had some relatives in England . I had mentioned Kleczewer earlier who was the managing director of the German automobile factory there in Germany . I knew that they had made it to England but I had no idea where they lived in England . So , you just sort of went along from day to day to see what tomorrow brings . It may sound stupid , okay . But , I had a good time . Okay , I mean , there was n't that much food but we had buddies , friends . We could go out explore things in the woods , pick mushrooms , pick blueberries , pick wild strawberries , we could run down to the brook and bath in the brook . There were as a matter of fact , there were also some boy scout activities going on and for the life of me I can not remember but it was brought back to me when someone a few years ago suddenly produced a photograph of a group of Jewish scouts , okay and I 'm
2804	3065	2803	2803	I	0	'm not going into town and mixing . About the closest that I might come to mixing with others was in school . I knew that some of these classmates also were Jewish refugees hidden from Germany or wherever their origins were but I did n't know where they lived . We did n't exchange addresses , if you will and we would meet in school but there too , they basically kept us busy . Okay , they kept our noses to the grind stone and there was n't that much dialog going on and when it came to any kind of recreational activities and so forth , we pretty much did it within our own group in the house in which we lived . We played with and we stayed together , that group . So there was n't that much contact with other groups . We knew of other houses or homes and we knew that there were other kids living there but we did n't know who the kids were or what kid lived in what home so , and there were no organized activities to bring the kids from one home together with the kids of another home . I met Andre Trocme , well first of all Andre Trocme came and visited at Les Grillons on several occasions . At that time , again , I certainly was not aware of what a splendid individual this man was and he was just one of the older people who were looking after us . The Trocme '

3935	4178	3903	3903	they	123	'm assuming here , that we better disperse these kids and close down Les Grillons . I think Les Grillons supported , if not totally financed , it was supported by the Quakers . The Quakers had very close ties with Pastor Trocme . Trocme , before the war , had been a pacifist and draft resistant . He refused to serve in the French armed forces and urged other people to refuse to serve in the military and that 's one of the reasons why they assigned him to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon , which was a forlorn , God - forsaken place up there and they figured he would n't get headlines as he was getting in whatever parish he had before . That he was in a larger city and the Protestants felt that his vociferous and noisy speeches about draft resisting and so forth are not helping their cause . So they assigned him to Le Chambon - sur - Lignon parish and got him away from the headlines from the journalist and then he became the moral leader of Le Chambon - sur - Lignon . He never told people what they had to do . He never told them you must hide people or you must take them in and there were , this is another one of the puzzling and remarkable things . It was n't managed where somebody says , okay , we 're
4853	4965	4852	4852	We	157	're looking at a postcard that was taken probably in the late 1930s of a house which is marked Pension De Famille . It was a boarding house or a bed and breakfast , if you will . And that house , a solid house built of rocks , the Les Grillons , the home where I lived from the time that I arrived in Le Chambon - sur - Lignon in the beginning of 1943 , until I left in late 1943 , it was called Les Grillons . And Daniel Trocme was the den father , I guess you would call it , who looked after us in that house .
