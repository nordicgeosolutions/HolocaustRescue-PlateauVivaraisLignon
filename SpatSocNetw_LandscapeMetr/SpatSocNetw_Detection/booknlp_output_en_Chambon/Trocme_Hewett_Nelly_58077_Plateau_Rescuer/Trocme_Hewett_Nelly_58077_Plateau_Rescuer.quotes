2652	2702	2651	2651	I	0	'm sure they would start first with our house or with the Catholic Church , you know . But very soon , other names became known , but they did n't knock on any door . They did n't get off the train and take the first door and knock .
3249	3273	3248	3248	I	0	'm sure that among the Jewish people too , I mean , there is the ideal and then there is what people really are .
3648	3824	3600	3603	headmaster of the school	351	' 39 , it profited immensely from the refugees who came in , because it was there . There was a staff , that staff grew because it needed to grow . And among the teachers , there were quite a few Jewish people who were themselves refugees , so , who came there as refugees and found they could have a job , a small job that did n't pay much . Meanwhile , the students who were refugees too came there and realized that as refugees , they could find a school and continue their education . And so they came . If they could pay tuition , they did . If they could n't , they did n't . So that school , that school grew and profited immensely from the refugees , and it very soon became a school of 400 and some students , and it still is a school of 400 and some students . Oh , yes , I was very aware that many of my classmates were Jews .
4141	4552	4140	4140	I	0	'm not satisfied . There is too much going on . What I do does n't seem to me important in this time of stress and terrible human problems . I 'd like to do something . Do you have something I could do in Le Chambon - sur - Lignon in order to participate into the activities of the area . And my father said , Absolutely , just come up and we 'll find something for you to do . And so Daniel Trocme came up and became the director of one of those homes for children . The home was Les Grillons . Of course , many Jews were living in that home . Pretty soon , the director of another one of these homes could not continue his work . I do n't remember the story . Remember , I was only 14 , 15 , I was not in on all the politics , because there was politics . So my father said , well , temporarily , Daniel , why do n't you also try to assume the leadership of that other house called the House of the Rocks . All right . So Daniel ended up having a lot of responsibilities , because being the leader of those houses was to take care of the children , to replace their father and mother very often . He babied the little ones . He was very good with the little ones . He gave support to the big ones . It was to make sure those kids were educated . Either went to public school or went to the College Cevenol , or went into training , like Jack Lewin , again , whom you have met this weekend , who was working with a carpenter , learning to be a carpenter , all right , and most of the responsibility was finding food for these people , because to get food at the time , you had to have food , food coupons , or buy at the farms . To get food coupons , you had to have an identity card , because no one could be delivered coupons unless you had a valid identification . So to get identification for some of these people who were refugees hidden , you had to find false identification . Okay , so it was a huge responsibility , a lot of work , without money .
